is this usable in survival at all or no
alright- but also
i uh
placed down a panel in creative
and it immediately crashed the game
soooo
like a compressor panel
i was using the latest update
might have something to do with it
idk
kk
i cant even get mine off the ground :P
also the wires dont render for me
they're just invisible
not connected to the ground, assembled and physics enabled, and i linked the compressors up to eachother
i rebuilt it and just gave each compressor a lift lever
and that didnt work either
so
yeah
i figured out the relay thing a tad too late
nvm im an idiot
i was setting the target height to like 100
while being on a mountain
the SS cobblestone monstrosity is a go
aaaand ive run into your problem
:P
true
basically
the propellors dont work
at all
yea
linked it up to a relay and then to the gearbox
wdym
i feel insanely
dumb
no
no matter what setting the telegraph is
it doesnt actually do anything
ive
tried that
gimme a sec

idk
4 way movement
dont question it
but it still doesnt work even with just one
i used the rela
you can literally see it
what is this some kind of game where you can just whack something with a wrench to fix i-
**oh wait**
lmao
twas making a joke
ravenfield is gg
paid version idk if its worth it tho
I once tried to stick
A techguns turret on
In one of the older versions
What I got was:
***another time I tried to stick a quarry on it***
I will recreate the quarry incident in a moment
But I do need to say that
How did thyne fix it
Kk
Victory?
I placed the gearboxes sideways
It is time
To recreate the death of the universe
I HAVE THRUST
VICTORY
Problem
im turning left

and
my propellors
arent rebuilding

i thought they were
only supposed to be on the bottom
nice quark blocks
the skeleton of the prydwynn
I would answer but
I heard that the new version of thaum is bad
So I haven‚Äôt installed it yet
Idk
Last time I used it was
1.7.10
And ages ago
So
Don‚Äôt take my word for it
I like the old version
Where you slap on a shit ton of doped etherium
And send the entire chunk flying into space
I can say that I like the old version and still want to use the new version
Imagine making a Valkyrien warfare ship
ON a valkyrien warfare ship
It‚Äôs really easy to find but I will warn you
Don‚Äôt try and xray for it
My friend did
It sends streaks of blue s t r e t c h y  models across the screen
Atleast we think it‚Äôs the cause
That was the same with etherium
f l o a t
Except this time the ore floats too
Dungeon defenders
The crossover thing is a wave fight
It‚Äôs really hard
@ThioJones
You buy it from the not
Npc*
And it is hard
I had solar flare armor and a bunch of post moonlord weapons
And I couldn‚Äôt do shit
You speak high of yourself before you get gangbanged by a 7000000 hp dragon bitch
Eternia Crystal
mayhaps you should go and die
no shit Sherlock you‚Äôre a Devvy boi you know that this mod is less stable then a rotted away wooden plank suspended over a cliff
Say that to my face as I place down a doped etherium on a ship made of mod blocks and it shits itself glitching into the sky and back down cuz the game can‚Äôt handle it
Not one doped etherium obviously but you get my point
Yes I know but the point is that doped etherium is stupidly op

I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a bug tho because
When you disassemble it
It stays working
please, everyone
Swamp had actually good features
@ThioJones I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing but I saw sphax and now I‚Äôm intrigued
Ah
Valkyrien Skies - Super buggy and weird
Who put the gravity infuser on this man‚Äôs camera
*block of etherium*
I once used those blocks in the old version of the mod to make a bunch of chunks on a super flat world take off to the skies
OH GOD
MESSAGE DUPLICATION
*get down*
Ahem
And that‚Äôs my ted talk on why Valkyrien is good and Davinci‚Äôs Vessels is god awful
Use old valkyrien
It works
And I mean like go back to the version that still had cannons
I never had that happen
Doped etherium is way cooler
What do you mean slide
If you propel a chunk of land at another chunk of land
It moves across the other chunk
I feel like downloading that version is like
And expecting it to work
Good luck with your game not immediately crashing upon attempting anything big
Yea
I tried the new version, was really bad at it but it‚Äôs cool
T.hat was a while ago
I haven‚Äôt used Skies in over like- 3 weeks
Don‚Äôt ask what compelled me to make a ship diagonally
I found a chunk of a mountain and was just like
***fly***
But when it didn‚Äôt work like the old version I was like
I don‚Äôt think it was ever organized???
The menu always seemed like a jumble of half working stuff and half unfinished
well in those days there was more than one kind of engine
Now it‚Äôs parts of an engine
ALSO-
Well
I held a part of the compressor
In my hand
And the game died
That was a while ago tho
Yeah it just
Idk rendering issue or something
It just didn‚Äôt like that version so I used an older version from curseforge and it was fine
About the new version in general-
The only glaring issue with the old was item pickup from the ground for me
Also permenant Entity gluing to my ships
I made a flying battle arena once with techguns and VW
it worked fine
New VS just doesn‚Äôt have the same feel
The old one felt almost charming because of its stupidity
And the fact that with a chair
The actual lift of the Craft was just- negated
And you could fly around without care
:squinty:
Tf version did I download then because I saw nothing related to the old engines
I‚Äôve been downtalking the new version a lot but
More finished?
Like they don‚Äôt seem as whooptity fuckin broken
Are you guys ever planning on having two ships not just phase through eachother like an unstoppable object vs an immovable force
Ah
Okie
That‚Äôll be cool
I feel very left out
Plasma power
Btw
Idk if that‚Äôs been brought up
Probably has
But I had both installed and it caused any rocket made to have its model fuckin stretch across time and space for a second and then go invisible leaving behind permenant invisible barriers in my world
I never tested what happened with VW ships tho
Plasma engines are for all intents and purposes
Me: installs a bunch of custom block mods for design purposes
Can it move obsidian?
I‚Äôm asking too many questions but
hold on
Top 10 photos before disaster
You‚Äôve been beanboozled
woah woah woah
No rockets to Mars
...that mod isn‚Äôt updated yet
*fingerguns*
When you try to make a sick elevator but the physics say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to fuse with KSP‚Äù
@MaErIoO
hey everyone- hows it going?
oh god what the fuck have i done

i attached a bunch of nukes to a vk ship, dissassembled it and they went off
just gonna
also
flew up into the heavens when the crater appeared
:tnt_boom:
For what?
The nukes?
IC2
The problem with the mods then is that when two/more of them are present together it causes an issue
Is it still buggy?
then one/two of those 5 mods
Need to be shot
Without
*without*
w/ means with
w/o means without
Has anyone else been able to replicate this issue or
Then is this whole issue moot? It seems like a hardware/software issue unrelated with any of the mods involved
I can make a large ship and test it
But I don‚Äôt know what mods you even have
*you see, that‚Äôs where the problem probably lies*
I‚Äôve made entire clusters of chunks fly in the old one without issues
So it may even be just from how the new version handles physics that  it‚Äôs not made to handle that sort of stuff
I would know, I‚Äôve made fireball firing hell raisers of ships
Using dispensers
hmmmmm
I‚Äôd love to but I‚Äôm currently not at my pc
How long have you been playing minecraft?
@hoobooh
And you‚Äôve only seen it... twice.
*press X to doubt.*
I know
I‚Äôm doubting the validity of that
I‚Äôve played since early 2013 and I‚Äôve seen plenty of slimes- even made slime chunk farms
Slimes are common if you know where to look
No, dark oak is superior to spruce
Also maybe just make other wood variants so that people with lighter color schemes can use
there aren‚Äôt in vanilla, but that‚Äôs because the crafting bench is oak and came out before other wood types existed
MORE POWA
...*stares at doors, logs, fences, planks, fencegates*
buttons
stairs
slabs
walls
*buttons*
New snapshot
They have blue torches now
Still a color variant
Also Better idea: make it so that you can just wrap any texture around it by right clicking with a block so that nobody gets pissy
I mean
It doesn‚Äôt get any more complex
It‚Äôs a texture change
you just- wrap the texture of planks around that part of the model depending on what program is used
I mean I‚Äôve only used blockbench like
Twice
and I occasionally use blender but not for anything Mc related
I‚Äôm aware blockbench sucks, it took me hours to texture this fucking thing:
Hold on lemme find the thing
:kcraft:
Texturing with it is legitimately impossible
It‚Äôs very basic
It can‚Äôt really do much that blender can
Frankly I think the ‚Äúedgy‚Äù one is the one trying to argue with everything anyone says
so you‚Äôre a hypocrite? Defending something you don‚Äôt use
We‚Äôre not making outrage, we‚Äôre having a discussion
You just like to argue :hueh:
A hypocrite is one who does something they actively speak against
Or vise versa
You don‚Äôt use blockbench yet you defend it like it‚Äôs your firstborn child
I do use it, it sucks
That‚Äôs not the same thing in the slightest
It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre using blockbench for the wrong purpose
It just sucks at doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do
Sandpaper is not meant to be used as toilet paper
Blockbench *is* meant to be used for modeling
Nica just wants to argue
They‚Äôre trying to defend something they don‚Äôt like or use
ok very simple solution:
Does that make ms paint good?
No.
It depends on who‚Äôs using it
Not for some people.
So you‚Äôre saying if something is better than nothing there are no negatives and it‚Äôs perfect
alright, lemme go sleep outside on the ground with a bear as my pillow
new art trend: edit the bytes of the image individually over the course of a week
I‚Äôd work with some other 3d program
Like maya
fuck it, if you‚Äôre gonna be like that i won‚Äôt use blockbench I‚Äôll use Minecraft itself with a mod that lets me turn blocks into 3D models
But we‚Äôre debating opinions right now
:hueh:
...that‚Äôs an opinion
Nica, considering your pfp is hentai and you‚Äôre very argumentative I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you were an edgy 11 year old, but am I arguing that? No.
Pretty much.
‚ÄúIn which case you‚Äôre too young for discord‚Äù
A conditional statement in referring to arguing over opinions
but we ARE debating opinions on programs.
You don‚Äôt think it sucks, we do.
That‚Äôs an argument of opinions.
It was directed at me
Since I‚Äôm apparently too young for discord I can‚Äôt understand what nica is saying and therefore, their argument is null to me. Let‚Äôs just go about our day
Blockbench being good is not an objective truth, it‚Äôs what you continue to attack us over. I‚Äôm ending the argument here because we‚Äôre not talking about this dumb shit anymore.
Alright, keep mocking me instead of ending the argument because it‚Äôs derailed into petty insults.
Nothing to do with you two
I‚Äôm talking to  nica
and? You‚Äôre taking something I said and putting quotes around it, suggesting you‚Äôre saying it with a sarcastic tone.
Yeah Imma just shut up because I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble over a stupid fucking argument.
Peace out
Anyways-
what were we talking about it again
Me: turns towards model
When that model enters the game everyone‚Äôs computers collectively melt and reform into an AI tyrant hell bent on destroying the person who made that model
Ah right, I forgot that the computers‚Äô internal components will combust the second the model is in your peripheral vision
this is minecraft, logic doesn‚Äôt apply
you can make a block of diamonds
Which would be compressed crystals
diamonds are crystallized carbon
They are still crystals.
Yes, actually.
They.... are crystals.
By definition, they are crystals.
There‚Äôs no arguing that, it‚Äôs just what they are.
Not only are they still crystals but if he can do that to diamonds, he can do it to valkyrium
The whole... start of this convo?
that‚Äôs called glass
Diamonds are crystallized carbon
Carbon is an element
It‚Äôs not an argument, it‚Äôs just... fact?
Like- do a second of googling.
Diamonds are crystallized carbon.
Wha- it‚Äôs scientific fact? That‚Äôs not ‚Äòcommon consensus‚Äô it‚Äôs scientifically a crystal
So something assembled as a crystal at the atomic level makes it... not a crystal.
no, they‚Äôre just crystals period.
It is
It literally is
It‚Äôs also based on the atomic structure of a diamond, which is a crystalline structure.
Because that‚Äôs what crystals are?
Do you not understand how definitions work
The actual science being that they‚Äôre crystals.
Wow you could like
Wait a second
Before responding with ‚Äúexactly‚Äù

no, it‚Äôs because they ARE THE SAME

Wikipedia is... accurate
How exactly does that even apply
Enjoy being argumentative, I guess.
I literally have no idea
I thought we were talking about textures
back to the texture idea:
To keep with the theme of the other parts
Like- the border is wood, then you can see glass overlayed on blue
I mean it is supposed to make things float right
so maybe a balloon :hueh:
jk, but probably some machine that just
Crushes it into a block
Like a piston maybe
That‚Äôd be hilarious
‚ÄúMy craft won‚Äôt lift enough...‚Äù
*ties balloons to a fence post*
*NYOOOM*
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs harder
When you try to port to 1.14 but 1.15 and 1.16 completely change obfuscation and how mods even work:
:e_cry:
Hytale won‚Äôt ‚Äòmake minecraft irrelevant‚Äô
Just because a game is better doesn‚Äôt kill the nostalgia that powers Minecraft, or take that nostalgia.
Plus, the majority of mc players are Bedrock edition.
There is no bedrock edition hytale.
Not that we know of.
So even if pc Minecraft is ‚Äòmade irrelevant‚Äô by it (it won‚Äôt be)
It‚Äôs just gonna flop like a second cubeworld
All of the hype around it already died
Like- months ago
And hypixel continues to worsen their reputation as their server‚Äôs quality decreases
They‚Äôve officially made Skyblock pay to win
No one is gonna want to buy a game from a poorly reputable server that is rapidly losing steam, borderline violating the eula, and neglecting watchdog to the point of hilarity
Watchdog can‚Äôt even stop *nuker* anymore
Mhmm.
Minecraft has content not because of literally more content or because of quests/rpg elements
It has content because it‚Äôs entirely up to the player to decide
What it can do
^
TikTok is getting banned and valorant is just league + csgo + overwatch
but that‚Äôs not really the topic
The graphics of hytale alone put me off not gonna lie
It looks like a Minecraft clone.
Fuckin mobile mc ripoffs look truer to real voxel games
All of this discussion about a game that might never come out lmao
Hypixel is struggling, if they fall then they won‚Äôt have the money to continue development
At least yanderedev actually finished one promised thing in 6 years
Not possible likely
Also space engineers is a boring, empty game
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs respectable
And teardown isn‚Äôt an actual Vogel game cause it‚Äôs just house flipper in space
Voxel*
Autocorrect please.
Wait no I‚Äôm thinking of Hardspace Shipbreaker
Carry on
most sold game in the world is definitely here to stay
No man‚Äôs sky actually resurrected itself
The devs fulfilled all their promises and then kept making updates, so people actually play it now
They added organic ships now
I have the game thanks to Gamepass but I haven‚Äôt played it yet
Been waiting to try it when I have time
They also made it actually multiplayer
Does sea of thieves count as a good mobile base :hueh:
Unturned is meh nowadays. Still waiting for 2/4.0
All community made
The creator is busy working on 4.0 but I only have like 3/4 the hours required to play the beta and I don‚Äôt feel like leaving the game on for a year
But the thing is the newer versions allow for mods to be way better
Like look at Create
or this mod
I don‚Äôt see how anything would be different. Porting work is still porting.
I mean, kinda maybe in some ways
Oh damn that‚Äôs not gonna work well is it
If you fly a ship with beacons on it underneath something, do the beacons stop working or do they pierce the land like a laser? If they don‚Äôt stop working, that could lead to some... interesting build ideas.
Pog
intimidation tactics
Humanity is not worthy of the power of fabric and forge at once
We would surely be smited by Zeus for meddling in the immortal realm smh
Lmao
Softbody physics in a block game is cursed even past the complete impossibility of making it and lack of use it has
from what I hear, magma is super unstable
It will be open when it's done, people were just harassing them over it so they closed it for development
aero and valkyrien are both epic mods that do similar things in very different ways and have entirely different focuses so i think they're on equal footing
i was told there was shit talk here
came to check it out
there was none
i was kinda quick on the draw to snap back but after taking a look here i feel bad for saying anything cause yall didnt start shit
ü´°
the create modding community much enjoys beef, sorry for that gamers
my bad for believing it at first glance
i prefer turkey

unfortunately, the aero discord has a track record of beef and arguments over stupid shit
the community does not represent the mod
üíÄ
I will say one thing
ill see yall later
üëã
I‚Äôm in the middle confused üíÄ
Considering the complete lack of drama in this place comparatively, I‚Äôm not convinced this was anything more than drama bait from someone
the ultimate mod
Hola
Aero discord on this topic: :a_FIRE:
Petty revenge ain‚Äôt the style
We‚Äôre eating good today with this bullshit
Idc what was copied or if it was copied, it‚Äôs just hilarious to watch the total meltdown of a server over a YouTube video
Not this place, theirs

askin the real questions
Create is officially on forge and fabric
Fabric is a bit behind iirc
Rip
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-fabric
Double breaker
The AI
That ai thing coded a mostly working computercraft program for a friend of mine
/srs
Worked with some tweaks
Except for the flaws

I can confirm, tipping super flat chunks was fun
Autocorrect downgraded my compliment
Multiblock hell
Nah we‚Äôre all reeling from the pain
ask it to define ‚Äúmid‚Äù
42
42
It‚Äôs 42
Don‚Äôt tell it about orespawn or it will go completely insane
Yes
You broke it
Projecting
Smh but if no 1.19 how am I supposed to

An addon for the Create mod that adds big clockwork mechs and companions with custom AI, as well as expands on the Deep Dark.
It doesn‚Äôt really expand on the mods
It just repeats what you say but verbose
Within the next twelve years
You underestimate
severely
The difficulty of downporting a mod like this
Yeah but vs2 is totally different
I‚Äôm aware you do
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not gonna be easier than an addon
You have to essentially rewrite the mod
üíÄ
It‚Äôs down to a pre-flattening version from a modern version
That‚Äôs not a small downport
I mean at least it‚Äôs not 1.7.10
Ah
Then yeah I can see why that would be easier if it‚Äôs essentially just organ transplanting vs core into vs1‚Äôs pre existing code
I just remember Matter Overdrive and how that got downported permanently to 1.7.10
LMAO
just have that mod port up :clueless:
I like how every single comment is about versions
Oh trust me I know
Reject mod loaders

Cope
Anyways nice bait
Unless he is truly deranged
:Troll:
Sounds like cope
At least when it does boot it has enough content mods to make it worth it
:Clueless:
I‚Äôve made several modpacks
Cope
If your forge takes 10 minutes to lord that‚Äôs on your drive
Genuinely cope
What ssd are you using
One from the Neolithic era?
You first :Troll:
Imagine wanting to have content mods
With fabric, I‚Äôd be lucky if it gets into the world to begin with
If y‚Äôall can exaggerate loading times I can exaggerate the amount of times fabric craps out on me :Clueless:
Then neither is mine

it‚Äôs how a dyslexic person writes spore

i would like to try 1.18 vs2 but i am too stupid to find out how
i figured\ it out
i was mostly joking about the stupid part
mostly
hmmm
idk
wait hold on
Try the mech's color palette
ill send rn back on my pc

LMFAO
fitting name
its disorganized but
i mean what do you expect from

GReG's color palette
wait but if we change it to red and black
i have to retexture the entire mech
:diesofdeath:
is there any way to easily palette swap
:diesofdeath: but thats scuffed as shit
okay so i used the color fill tool overestimated the amount of red
this is obv not intentional but
LMFAO

motherfucker rusted
üíÄ
he been thru a bit
LOL
IKEA GReG
nah i got this
trust in the brust
im just gonna desaturate everything :Troll:
gonna look like shit
watch this
color variation? what for
bro now it looks absolutely depressed

goofiest
the thing is
the "lower the brightness in gimp" trick doesnt work
because this thing had an actually complex color palette
so when you reduce it
it just looks like

man's fuckin wage looped
depression
no koap i literally reduced the brightness on everything
it looks doodoo
this thing wasnt designed to be jet grey
LOL
gunmetal it is not
its simply metal with a gun
it just looks bland without any saturation
SMH

look how much character it just
loses
shit man its like a 2009 sonic oc
absolutely hideous
i didnt know you were an advanced rocketry texturer koap
nice contrast to the sass lord Klarkson
copper what do you think of wagie GReG vs content with his life GReG
i kinda liked the purple more on it tho
black and red is very er
it works but it doesnt have much personality beyond "fucking evil"
black and red also doesnt have much hue shifting or tones to work with because well
its fucking greyscale
its just not my cup of tea
but far less personality
i like to put a lot of personality into my models
like  the


da drippy
The best one ngl
I‚Äôll work on GReG alts
No
We‚Äôre not doing low effort saturation shifts for it
That‚Äôs lame
I will do an actual palette swap
My good sir I know how to hue shift, it did not look good
the ultimate power is having Valkyrien clockwork and the immersive engineering addon

I feel like neither is superior
They‚Äôve got too much in their respective courts
They‚Äôve all got ports

Forge and fabric simply need to join forces and create a best of both worlds
Yeah
But we can dream

It just
Got a new dlc
Like three weeks ago
Game bad, with one mod it makes forge load time look like millisecond
idk where you heard that
I just download the dlc from my local internet tradesman and put it in the dlc folder
And Rimworld just says ‚Äúokay‚Äù
Or download viruses
BLAST OFF

Are you talking about 1.16?
In 1.18, there‚Äôs selection box glue
You click on one end
Then you click on the other
And everything in the box is glued
Also chassis exist
They don‚Äôt have glue in between
They have one overarching box
That you can break
Glue system got totally overhauled
bruh oculus/rubidium runs 40fps complimentary on my dad‚Äôs 2012 iMac how the fuck you gettin 20 frames
I know I‚Äôm the potato but your computer is more of one
ahh nvm I understand entirely now
Both look clean as hell
I dunno
I kinda like the red
It breaks up the color more
Red
that scope effect is
actually sex
the one in the scope itself
not the one on the top

can always use a chassis

I rise from the ashes
:guh:
time to get back to work on the propulsion addon
you‚Äôre right
I am a potato
is there a way to track issues seperately-
Fair enough
:Troll:

i was using eureka config code for their force
so each balloon applied
5000
LMFAO
5000 * -gravity is
apparently
i lowered it down to 1
but it still is batshit
idk
I don‚Äôt understand how you manage this
I just hold s and a
And I go stratospheric
Your bug abusing just ain‚Äôt efficient enough
CBC does work perfectly fine
it renders fucky
thats the issue
the cannons fire as youd expect
but iirc they render er
i remember null tried them
yeah they're literally just mixin'd create contraptions
they are no different from their contemporaries
@Nullharp you were testing with cbc before right, what exactly happened
according to null
from yesterday

yeah
they disasemble and reassemble between shots
so probably
they disassemble, get ammo shoved into the back, then assemble aim and fire
believe so
i can install it and test
it is a contraption
therefore it literally has to be an entity
because thats just how they work
gotcha
ruby wasnt looking in the registrate file
MOUNTED_CANNON
aka
"mounted_cannon"
its literally just
`MOUNTED_CANNON = ContraptionType.register(CreateBigCannons.resource("mounted_cannon").toString(), MountedCannonContraption::new),`
as in the modid?
the modid is "createbigcannons" ye
i will in fact
go pester moyai
actually dont hes chill
Create fabric has zero documentation on integration
forge has little but at least it has some
ham burger chees burger Big Mac whopper
My guy
How have you eaten
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SUGAR
I‚Äôm so confused
3 hours until I‚Äôm home
Classes cringe, I wish to torture my brain with coding
Still a lot of work to mess with
Dirt blocks are on a blacklist
They won‚Äôt be assembled
It will just refuse to assemble dirt
Doesn‚Äôt matter where it is
You can build with dirt on an assembled ship
But it will not assemble with a ship
There‚Äôs a few other things
It won‚Äôt assemble water or lava
It won‚Äôt assemble helms
There‚Äôs a list in config
The helm you use to assemble is not included in assembly logic iirc
What tech said
It won‚Äôt let you assemble more helms
I don‚Äôt think bpo works like you think it does
Gravity blocks on ships are funky
try it ‚ú®
no i did not

:guh:

For some reason
It‚Äôs not control because you can sprint fly in eureka I think
but idk why v was their next option
Aternos is just a host
It has nothing to do with broken mods
Though that is strange
based
honestly you should just be working in common so you don‚Äôt have to worry about that
But to each their own
Just cause of glue logic
I‚Äôm pretty sure they do work with chassis
@KwizzleHazzizle
@PHOBOSS is working on that
Iirc
Tnt cannons work
At least they should
Then again ‚Äúshould work‚Äù means nothing
Ah
I was under the impression that they did
What if you make ignited tnt a physics entity
1 block ship
:clueless:

(It would also mean you could bitchslap tnt with a ship to launch it)
If someone does that we should have a long fuse tnt so we can do stupid shit to launch it
Simple
Attach a farter
:Troll:
smh
Actually that does give me an idea for takeoff hold on
quark isn‚Äôt the sleeping bags
I believe it‚Äôs sophisticated backpacks?
Don‚Äôt quote me
I know travelers backpacks adds sleeping bags
Bruh
Ah
Comforts
The sleeping bag mod is comforts
Found it
Took me five seconds of googling
#server-ads ???
There‚Äôs entire severs based around it
(They won‚Äôt)
^^
It‚Äôs gonna need integration
Takeoff will probably end up adding long fuse physics tnt
Unlikely
The only world corruption as of late has been from takeoff and the numerous cases of assuming ships exist
it‚Äôs a beta after all
Yeah in actual gameplay no issues
Not with eureka as of right now
To TLDR what TPK said
We don‚Äôt know.
It‚Äôs a beta
There are none known
:diesofdeath:
They don‚Äôt listen in general
My non vanilla solution will be in takeoff but that‚Äôs not a real fix
Did you hit c
I don‚Äôt think alignment expects to get thrown that hard off course
It shat the bed when it did
You may have crashed physics engine
Check logs
It‚Äôll say ‚ÄúTHE PHYSICS THREAD HAS CRASHED‚Äù a bunch of times or similar

No :trol:

sorry none of the new one's lyrics are as memorable as anything from the old ones
damn
ngl the textures are scarily similar to create stuff on some of them lol
no shot

its true though
implying i already wasnt
got my account in 1.4
trolled
i meant beta 1.4 :clueless:
good
no
good
you dont know what we had to deal with
seethe
i did infact not suck at old pvp
i simply think its boring as shit
beta 1.4
for me
zamn
yes
no you see the problem there is you're saying it will release before 1.21
and i somehow doubt 1.21 is post heatdeath
soz
Plane
That doesn‚Äôt even look remotely like Minecraft
unlikely
any mod that's a physics overhaul
But it‚Äôs also heavy as shit
You‚Äôre building out of solid rock
Not yet unfortunately
Takeoff is working on 1.18 stuff like that but we probably won‚Äôt have a 1.16 backport
That‚Äôs not the point of cbc cannons
They‚Äôre create driven
You can use computers to aim and fire them but they don‚Äôt have numbered readouts
It‚Äôs less of computers aiming them and
More redstone doing it that the computer would control
That‚Äôs just how cbc cannons are

huh

something aint right then

vs1 rudders :guh:
there are """"wings"""" in takeoff
but uh
the almighty rudder
it almost has wings
it has something wing-adjacent
uhhh
oh in vs1?
isnt it some stupid shit like valkyrium
wdym
no its underground
but hitting it makes it physics enable and float up
honestly, i really like that mechanic
diamond level i think
been forever since i played vs1
eehhh?
i honestly dont notice it
as someone who primarily plays 1.12 modpacks, when i do play 1.18 ones with the boys theres hardly any difference (if anything its faster sometimes, or feels like it since i can see load progress)
perhaps
forge :armold_schwarzenegger:
do not have a threadripper
i have an i7
i dont remember what cpu i have exactly
lmfao
no
definitely not
you shouldve found some by now
oh lol
that wont fix load times
no
well i meant like
typical performance mods dont effect loading
if anything some make loading longer
because some performance mods preload things
iirc
its like
gold rarity
rarer than iron but more common than diamond
based
noice
honestly vs1 is
aggressively reminiscent of ie
i assume thats intentional
yeah welcome to vs1
youll always be confused
#takeoff will do redstone
@TechTastic's stuff will do cc
(and hopefully he'll help takeoff with cc stuff because im clueless lmfao)

:guh:
actually based
Did they try to assemble a ship out of a ship
That shouldn‚Äôt even be possible
^
I don‚Äôt get it
They do
‚ÄúThis block is already part of a ship‚Äù
That shouldn‚Äôt
Like even if they spammed the assemble button
It shouldn‚Äôt process it more than once
Actually take that with a grain of salt
Unsure if there‚Äôs a check
Yeah that‚Äôd do it
What exactly caused the crash
Like elaborate
So rendering
wait
Do you have
#deleted-channel probably the same issue
upgrade to beta 6 and try
also latest eureka
actually wait no
Tell them to do it on a single player
beta6 should have fixed that
But again tell her to try on singleplayer
That‚Äôs beta 2 and 3
We‚Äôre on beta 6
In singleplayer, try making a world with vs2 beta 6 and latest eureka, and place the supply ship on the vs2 ship
Not a vs2 ship
Some kind of supply ship mod
Oh it‚Äôs minecolonies
That‚Äôs not compatible with vs2 iirc
At all
new version won‚Äôt fix that
Just don‚Äôt use them on ships
Well think about that
is in the shipyard
As players are
I would love a like
Story focused vs2 based server once one of the major addons comes out
eureka could work but eureka doesn‚Äôt quite have the feel of needing a crew
Eureka airships are very like
Solo
I want a massive ship for me and the boys to have to run around managing
(Why do you think I‚Äôm making takeoff to begin with trol)
I shall change that or die trying
probably the latter /j
LMAO
:thumb:
the only people who will ever find compat issues are random people on the internet
you could scour the entirety of curseforge before you update
and some fucker will come out with a mod from the dark web
and say "no  comapt pls fxi"
other than create breaking everything for the umpteenth time
also didnt someone figure out how to fix glue
apparently it was because of an anti cheating measure
that didnt like how glue was being placed in shipyard narnia
away from the player
so with that glue should work on ships maybe possibly
which would be very based
^
literally just a check for player distance skull
mixin it to replace the check with a vs2 equivalent and we chillin ig
because mojang is like that
also move too quickly is the bane of my existence
thank god
honestly i could probably make a pr to fix the glue thing
if phoboss hasnt yet
id need to fix it seperately on forge and fabric right
afaik create fabric is its own beast
*looks at how many butchered imports they have* :guh:
i remmeber yesterday i was trying to see if create fabric's implementation of ChasingAABBOutline was any cleaner and
they have like 12 imports from a porting api
you mind if i try my hand at it then
very annoying
oh it is
trust me
i remember my journey to make my own potato cannon clone back in ye olde days
it took 18 classes
:haha:
without mixins, being a create addon is essentially impossible
everything is hardwired into eachother
it was a fun experience (not)
big cannons is all mixins afaik
alright time to bandaid fix us some glue
they are
found the problem code
its literally just a check in the glueselectionpacket and the glueremovalpacket
https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/blob/mc1.18/dev/src/main/java/com/simibubi/create/content/contraptions/components/structureMovement/glue/SuperGlueSelectionPacket.java
```if (player.distanceToSqr(superGlue.position()) > range * range)
i loved when mixinius said its mixin time and then mixed all over them
also instead of doing range squared they do range*range
which i guess thats the same thing
but sussy
lmfao
lemme see if the problem's any different in fabric
you wouldnt think but
who knows
i
it is
what the fuck
it does?
where
mixiniforgeplayer?
oh wait yeah it is
isCloseEnough
also i think this is doing it itself
i have a reference for mixining
thats nice
but as i was saying
for some reason
fabric does do it differently
they have another handler class
do you really think i know
"Certainly!"
whats your modlist?
and the error?
also, you shouldnt need dependencies other than KotlinForForge if using forge
yesntdve
it works but not 0.5g
glue is a bit funky
disassembly is unstable
waila
TOP is more stylistic
i did the do already
turns out that wasnt the issue
create fabric integration is no one‚Äôs job because traversing create fabric is even more of a jungle
i wouldnt wish create fabric's codebase on my worst enemy
it was a single line
to put the glue entity in the shipyard
:clueless:
https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Valkyrien-Skies-2/pull/268#issuecomment-1356506872
lmfao

oh dont worry
i tried all of the more complicated shit
before even checking if it was a shipyard entity
:clueless:
couldve saved myself 2 hours
and then i wasted another 2 trying to fix latest create
only for it to outright refuse to give me even a hint of a crash log
so that was fun
it wouldve been in the PR if i had any clue on what the problem even is

Fatass III
bane of Minecraft homes
if you want passive (or rather, powered but not player controlled) ship moving, that's not in eureka because its out of scope
stuff like takeoff and vs: clockwork will add those kinds of things
there are a lot of mods that decide to
do stupid shit
and as such
must be given special care like a kid with adhd
so they get in line
yes
oh shit its you :squint:
eureka and takeoff
but
takeoff barely works
you dont need to compile it yourself, walksanator compiled it for my server lemme grab it rq

same requirements as eureka
ehhh
its gonna be outdated in like a few hours
its just for meming purposes
with the magnets and thrusters and balloons that i still need to change the gradient for
cause rn they still just completely dip in power the second they hit y=256
lmfao
and since no aerial drag
then pull it back up
lose power
repeat
ive made vs ships into slimes :clueless:
yes
this man is a hackintosher iirc
he also complained when he couldnt run my modpack on a raspberry pi :clueless:
LMFAO
well no shit
booting a forge modpack from an sd card
is like trying to move an elephant with a guitar pick
the last straw was you saying some offensive bullshit i thought üíÄ
the build that the aero devs ban people for leaking in other discords
:clueless:
lmfao
its a shitty build but like
shitty builds are funny
they just wanna act like they're refined and pristine with their development process but you bet your asses they aren't
anyways enough of aero
this is vs discord last i checked
:trol:
smh
koap is "left" north
because
what direction is "left"
specifically
:What:
how did you manage even
they werent lying when they said "give it to koap or wash and itll break in 5 minutes"
well i mean
whenever an update releases
the server talks about it usually
Indeed
The grindset never stops
Ye but not main branch
I return gamers

None of that fake ass plastic shit
If it don‚Äôt smell like a forest in my living room what‚Äôs the point
I think that‚Äôs a known bug
takeoff
Take your time triode
It will only get more based with time
Do you have a lot of vessels?
Valkyrien does almost nothing to my server
:What:
What mods is your server running
Guh why is it using 30%
Somethings not right
Mine uses like 7 tops
What version?
Might want to upgrade vs2 and eureka
I thought that only happens for chests on ships
The flywheel experience
Because they get flywheeled
They‚Äôll render regardless of your distance from them
Since that‚Äôs the only way to get them to render at all rn
Due to flywheel cringe
But I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll get fixed soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
At least these devs show more progress than a laggy YouTube video every 3 months :clueless:
LMFAO
Yeah you should probably upgrade vs then
Hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me
I wonder if it‚Äôs a conflict?
Genuinely no clue
Good luck with that
Vs1 only even got boats at the tail end of its life
iirc
Valkyrium isn‚Äôt negative weight
If weight is negative the game crashes
Maths no like negative nunmbrs
Nani
Send a screenshot
I want to see this
LMAO
aw hell naw motherfucker runnin vs2 on a got damn eye fone!!
Unsurprising
What‚Äôs surprising is that it works at all
Especially without cydia
I believe in the dream
Insane really
Genuinely
That it runs at all
Vs1 would have made your phone melt down like Chernobyl :clueless:
Yes
Good job triman
Your bote mod runs on eyefone
If that ain‚Äôt optimized what is
It is a testament to how much time was spent making sure mod run well imo
And if it can run on an iPhone I fail to see what it can‚Äôt run on other than like
Grandma‚Äôs windows xp machine
Ye but I mean evidently it‚Äôs come a long way already
That‚Äôs like saying it‚Äôs better optimized than a toaster
But only because apple software is specifically optimized for the hardware
it‚Äôs weak when hit with things that aren‚Äôt intended for it
Damn
Also without jail breaking
It ran natively
Please continue to ruin it, it‚Äôs funny

That was my wifi for a long while and I didn‚Äôt even live in a forest
I lived in Brooklyn but my parents didn‚Äôt bother to upgrade my internet until the lockdown hit so for the majority of my life I was running on 2mbps internet
True true
Where I live optimum charges you half a liver for shitty ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù100mbps‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù internet that‚Äôs closer to ten
But
I live in the mountains
And have optimum wifi
Too many
Triode would say three
I fuckin wish
Optimum is a slimy company so when you run a speed test it will read very high but then actually doing anything it goes at like 4mbps
I have 2 lowes, a Home Depot, an IKEA, and a Best Buy that‚Äôs large enough to be a hardware store
Within 40 minutes of me
Okay how does ikea not count
Get lost in ikea
Live a normal life in one of the displays
I have a whole ass lumber mill a little down the mountain does that count

You forgot to clean
This is architectury
If you don‚Äôt gradle stop gradle clean gradle genSources
Nothing will work
Just download IntelliJ you cheapskate
Can‚Äôt wait until I get my laptop so I can access GitHub in school
The school computer lab has it blocked
Smh
Yeah it‚Äôs annoying
How am I supposed to no life develop if I can‚Äôt open git
They do actually
I‚Äôm in an ap Java course
It‚Äôs piss shit easy and practically nothing tho because it‚Äôs a high school programming course
üíÄ
It‚Äôs literally an ap course and they‚Äôre teaching me how to declare a class
Like bro
It is
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm on my phone rn
I don‚Äôt have a laptop yet
Ye
I‚Äôm getting it for chrima
No I‚Äôm in the computer lab
Cause Java class
I looked at Amazon to peek at what laptop it was btw
I forgot tho hold on I have it saved somewhere
It‚Äôs completely overkill
Cause I never ask for anything from my parents other than food to not starve so they get me one big Christmas gift each year
It‚Äôs this thing
It has two screens so I can have more than one tab open
Very sex
I can put all my sidebar tools on the bottom screen
My main problem with laptops is always the fact that once you‚Äôve used two screens for so long
It‚Äôs hard to go back to one
So having a second half-screen even is nice
Same thing here, my coding teacher doesn‚Äôt even know programming that great- I‚Äôm a higher skill level
Admittedly I‚Äôm usually not that bad at programming (my brain just refuses to accept kotlin)
But I shouldn‚Äôt be better
:diesofdeath:
That is a yikes
Good coders don‚Äôt teach because good coders use GitHub and stack exchange
LMFAO
The school computers only have network blocking not download blocking
I have installed every flash game possible on it
Including super smash flash
Obviously
Except it is trol
They don‚Äôt stop any downloads at all
So you can put in a direct download link
And it will say it‚Äôs blocked
But it will still download
LMFAO
?
They use a browser plug in
You are overestimating my school
üíÄ
Cope I guess
How would that be breaking a rule
Also I should be allowed to slander my school :clueless:
Also that‚Äôs not slander
What‚Äôs the issue exactly?
Not home
Will try soonish
I can
I can interpret create fabric just fine
It‚Äôs not that much more confusing than normal create it‚Äôs just a degree
takeoff will have engines (was the original point) but not create based
It‚Äôs essentially copy pasted normal create actually
Because porting lib just adds all the missing forge functions
Scuffedly, but it does
Porting lib is not based
Porting lib is terrible
Because fabric doesn‚Äôt have what create needs to work by default
Trol
You load ten seconds faster, and for what
Smh
Then again architectury doesn‚Äôt have any of it from either side :clueless:
Considering one of the screenshots for vs2 on curseforge has a beacon shooting through a hoop
I believe 1.16 will get caught up once release but focus is 1.18
or 1.19
probably skip to 1.20
honestly
aka even numbers
notice how only even numbered updates have been good since 1.14
actually 1.15 was good on the backend but added almost no content
1.14 good
a good backend update
but still just backend
and somehow ruined it
1.19 is
definitely bad
barely any content, awful chat report system
and lag
no dont drop java support
what
thats not what we want at all
we want them to release updates that have good enough content to warrant an update and dont entirely break the back end
we dont want them to ditch the game entirely
i mean it can
because
mod
its not very hard to block :trol:
No
This mod ran on ifone
It will run fine :clueless:
You fucking idiot
I wonder why teleporting to the shipyard is disabled
Hmm
To set a create filter
üíÄ
Wash you‚Äôre modelling a realistic plane engine
Don‚Äôt speak smh
Yes
Except not
Because it runs well enough to not care
Will be soon
Once triode is done polishing constraints
Someone made a car
That does that
But no tank yet
It does work on servers
But latest eureka build on cf
Isn‚Äôt compatible with latest vs2 on cf
Actually sussy
It may be krunch-y but it‚Äôs butter smooth
Eureka beta 4 no worke
It crashes on assembly
Ye walks had to compile from GitHub
to get our server to run
Pensive
You can make contraptions on ships
It can
iirc
I think anyways
I don‚Äôt remember if drills on a contraption on a ship work
Might be too many layers of abstraction
I‚Äôm aware of that much
And honestly it makes sense
Create contraptions don‚Äôt have vs2 collision and they probably won‚Äôt unless clockwork decides to make them vessels
So
You could theoretically drill through the floor
Which is mega sus
Like
You could build a tall contraption
Put drills on the tip
Then flip a ship over and have it spin
Drilling like seventeen blocks underground
That seems mega sus
When clockwork comes out ye
For now tho I‚Äôd say the fact that contraptions work on board the ship is fine enough
Being able to farm on a ship is cool
If you have a farm built on the ship it does
I feel like the use cases for create contraptions interacting with things not on the ship are slim anyways other than making like wheels which constraints can already do
I guess a spinning drill on the front of the ship is kinda cool but it also feels like it would be hella jank
It‚Äôs essentially that you have to disable the stabilize controller
And that would require very fucky wucky
It‚Äôs not about breaking the helm, it‚Äôs just about turning off the auto stabilizer, but that‚Äôs annoying to do‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Walks
Can you not
Confuse yourself and everyone around you
It‚Äôs not about breaking the ship helm
It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a function call for Stabilize whenever the eureka controller is present
stabilize(
This is what walks wants to be able to disable
And require some rewriting of eureka code exclusively for this purpose
Which seems very out of character for eureka
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not in scope for eureka to add a ‚Äútoggle stabilization button‚Äù
I don‚Äôt think
Ye but your cc stuff is also not actually adding mechanics to eureka itself
Adding the ability to toggle stabilization is a mechanic
The ability to make a computer input wasd for you is not, you could technically do it with a macro and default eureka :clueless:
Yes
I can‚Äôt wait to abuse this to the fullest
It‚Äôs because it has weight
And isn‚Äôt just arbitrarily attached
It sags
An excessively long pole with no supports on one end will not remain perfectly stable
Yes
Because I believe they can snap
Triode said something like that before
I don‚Äôt know I just know he planned to
It would make sense that it can be overstressed beyond it‚Äôs limit tho
Makes it actual physics and not just point hinge
Well
Drooping actually makes sense tho
Hinges shouldn‚Äôt be perfect rigid
Good systems have some wiggle tolerance
Otherwise they‚Äôre brittle
fair
Maybe the rigidity of a hinge is configurable?
More rigid hinges are precise but brittle
Build something off the hinge
I‚Äôd imagine
For docking purposes I‚Äôd imagine
Is what they‚Äôre asking
Once they‚Äôre ready I will aggressively program all of takeoff‚Äôs constraint joints
Yes.
LMAO
THE POONS
I CAN MAKE THE POONS
we win these
wait a minute
Genius
I asked a while ago if I could make a ragdoll entity and ewou said yes eventually so technically
Ye we can cheat aerodynamics a bit since it‚Äôs just a prop
good lord
You hit something and it ragdolls
I found a krabby patty formuler for basic drag
Yesterday
I gotta find it again tho
Can‚Äôt you calculate the surface area of all exposed blocks surface of the direction the ship is moving
Actually that sounds like hell nvm
Well every block will have a surface area of 1 unless it‚Äôs not a full block
And if it‚Äôs not a full block assume 1/2
:clueless:
Technically not wrong
You could say stairs count as a slope
Depends on the modpack
It‚Äôs stable if you don‚Äôt have any incompatible mods
Check the wiki
But specifically
Create latest doesn‚Äôt work
(0.5g)
They broke their entire rendering system in one update
:haha:
When triode implements fluid physics do I make takeoff gas pipes leak accurately simulated gas
:trol:
Le minecraft accurate tragic engine room accident
Oops! Hydrogen leak
Hmm
Yes
What devices don‚Äôt support fp64
Shit
I have nvidia
Ah
So cringe :(
What about doing it on cpu
:(
Not in eureka
And not in base vs2
Is there any way fp64 could run without requiring a nasa supercomputer
*= .99 is cringe
Bleh
I didn‚Äôt see .99
Multiplying velocity constantly by .99
Artificial ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùdrag‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
It‚Äôs not cool tho
Very lameo
Yeah
Just doesn‚Äôt mesh
Ye but for the rest of us non 1.12ers
Cope
So if we use fp64 would we be locking the mod to amd gpus
We did magnetic field calculus for magnets, we will do nasa maths for aerodynamics :Troll:
But actually is there any way to use fp64 that would be viable at all
Lmfao
:Thonk:
True
Worst case
Andrupka tries to run it on his raspberry pi again
Well I meant with fp64
It would not
Even come close
Smh
Minimum requirement will have to be 32
That seems fair
No grandma pc :(
Contraptions don‚Äôt have collision
That‚Äôs clockwork‚Äôs job
But then we can‚Äôt even have it in Minecraft
It will never run period
Much less on any computer
Difficulty to program vs usability
I have a suggestion
Make the fluid physics a mini addon
Just something that some addons can like jar in jar
But for people who physically can‚Äôt run it
:guh:
Fair
I mean this is a lot of speculation for a thing that won‚Äôt exist until we‚Äôre all like forty /j
I‚Äôm gonna need to make bastardized aerodynamics for takeoff in the interim
As said I did find a tad sussy formula which I could use
I‚Äôm not doing .99 tho, I will find some middleground
Lmfao
We just gotta make takeoff and clockwork and then show them off and intel will crawl out of the shadows to offer you money to slap their logo on it all
Big brain
Uhhh
Shit
Lie :trol:
That‚Äôs alpha‚Äôs job though I could try my hand at it
I‚Äôve got other stuff to focus on tho
Honestly go for it
Open source is open source for a reason
I don‚Äôt even think trains work on forge so
You‚Äôd be pioneering
Though to be fair I think the reason they don‚Äôt work on forge is because trains haven‚Äôt been set as shipyard entities
Lmao
I did a fix for cbc cannons but haven‚Äôt made a PR because I can‚Äôt compile to check if it works (my forge is being dumb and won‚Äôt grab parchment)
Should be similar for trains
wdym by that
Lemme go check out the station block actually
I thought create fabric was a version behind
Like it was still on f
Also the distance check overrides are on forge iirc
At least, they have one version for forge player
Idk if they have them for fabric
Also it probably won‚Äôt let you place trains on rails cause they aren‚Äôt shipyard entities yet
Balls
Can‚Äôt wait to tear into them and then immediately break something :trol:
Very sex
Why vec3 and not vector3d
Vanilla vectors :diesofdeath:
I‚Äôm aware lol, im a create addon dev
Guh?
Disgusting
I know
I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs yucky
Lmfao
Oh wait
Don‚Äôt you need to subtract the shipyard position to get the position in real world
Or no
blockpos :3drevenge:
Why no +0.5 to y
guh
what happened
Did I miss something bad
I was busy procrastinating and laying down
Ah
sus?
just downgrade the addons
create can‚Äôt be updated
Because 0.5g broke everything trol
press c
to activate cruise
itll hold the direction you were moving when you pressed c
They don‚Äôt work yet, but I was gonna make a pull request with my changes to fix them
Only issue is that my forge refuses to compile properly and until I figure out why I don‚Äôt wanna risk PRing a broken solution
A 1.19 version does exist but it‚Äôs not a priority ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
#vs2-updates
Also Imma bet eureka is not
Like
tru
It‚Äôs all kot
and also smaller
I mean
Not like you don‚Äôt have to redo create compat anyways
:trol:
Create r&d is for 1.19 üòî
My mod

The mechas
The good news is
1.19 didnt change nearly as many mappings as 1.16-1.18
Just a handful and the remappings honestly got simpler (and less randomly named or in random ass folders)
Also the built in support for keyframed animations is nice
We will simply only actively support even numbered versions
Cause we have to skip a version for mojang to have added any noticeable content though :trol:
Yes
Simply write a library to translate mappings
Trol
Ye but I mean for stuff that ain‚Äôt version agnostic
There is actually
A reference for mapping translations
linkie
True, but porting manually is too
If I had my laptop I could compile it but
Yes
I am
Likely
Keyframing, and the sculk
I genuinely don‚Äôt know what else
Oh also chat report
But chat report I‚Äôm convinced is half the reason the game runs worse
It was anti-1.15
It undid half the fixes 1.15 did and made the game laggier, and the only benefits are stuff that few would appreciate
like the keyframing system
:clueless:
To be fair they are building on a decade of spaghetti
And they‚Äôre too lazy to untangle it
So it will just get worse
Looks at kingbdogz
Trol
Thermal dynamics when :clueless:
Somewhat on topic for that but is it just me that finds the thermal dynamics argument of ‚Äúit‚Äôs a complicated mod hard to port‚Äù doesn‚Äôt hold as much ground after like 3 years when far more complex mods have made the leap
:diesofdeath:
guh
On it cap

Lmfao
If takeoff keeps scope creeping at its current rate we‚Äôll have a game built on vs2 don‚Äôt worry :clueless:
We‚Äôve already got what planned now
Scope creep? Please, scope forward march
It‚Äôs not like tools
It‚Äôs tiered materials for pipes and shit
Ewou wanted to add it
Cause he‚Äôs tetra obsessed
:trol:
Electromagnet gaming
Technically possible to make a gigantic motor joint with magnets and a constraint to lock them
Considering it‚Äôs for logistics
It‚Äôs more
Like
Porosity
Stability
You want performance to shoot peoples better
Not snazzy lighting to make your pc explode
When you round a corner too fast
Gsync makes my monitor‚Äôs colors look like dogshit
my monitors look significantly worse with it on, and that‚Äôs a problem, because I‚Äôm an artist
And I can‚Äôt afford to have color inaccuracy
>:(
That‚Äôs not a good way to do that
Water occlusion is far superior
Actually we need a good sealed room calculation for a lot of stuff, and water occlusion is one of them
Splitting ships is also iirc
*Maybe ill try my hand at that*
?
Bet
Where
I want to look
Saw it
It will be
It‚Äôs required for ship splitting
Valkdrive + takeoff :trol:
@Wash washwater crush depth when
Tank easy
Rope constraint chain + motors + an attachment point somewhere
are we gonna need pen rounds in takeoff :guh:
i have the version that does
i have to actually
send it tho
lol
ask it

this happens with everything
including cbc cannons
which i fixed the rendering and the positioning of
but not the firing
all of them
vs doesnt use an alternative dimension
vs uses the main world
and it doesn't load ships fully, so thats not why
i mean
it supports up to 256x256 chunks in size
so
go ham
they do
something might be fucky wucky with your game
0.5g detected
flywheel still causes rendering errors in things other than create
cause it changes a bit of under the hood stuff
the crashing thing is a chest
chests are edited by flywheel
so idk
damn
the 90% chance that saying an issue was caused by create failed me for the first time
:clueless:
ah
jesus christ
did you try to assemble that in one go?
thats waaay too big to assemble in a single pass
oh also
the reason it wont move probably even if it is assembled
is because it has no thrust and no balloons
there's no way passive thrust can move that thing
it has the mass of the average city
hmm
is there a config option for maximum assembly size
cause i think that 100% is too large for a default
youll also have to remove grass and stuff from the blacklist-
because that has a lot of grass
actually
it might be assembling and getting stuck on the grass
probably shouldnt remove that lol
hmmm
there is a way to assemble that big of a thing
its just janky cause of how massive it is
i wonder if you could load a schematic of it on an existing airship?
worth a shot perhaps
i believe you can place a schematic on a ship-
well assembly logic doesnt like it
i mean its an improvement
its really trying
also that means half of it is one ship
and half of it is another
i think
and also one half really wants to tilt
the engine CAN handle ships this large
i just dont think it likes *making* them all that much
i mean again
you might as well try to load it as a schematic on an existing ship
i wont guarantee it will work
but
ohhh
if you get create back, you can paste it as a create schematic
assuming you set the max create schematic size high enough
its also create fabric
so it has a 50% chance of crashing
somethin funky goin on here
no, it has its own schematic type
you save it with a schematic and quill
and selecting both ends of the blueprint
it uses .nbt
kekw
Speaking of bugs
I said the same thing twice in the same message smh
The 1am grindset
@Triode can you put somewhere that create 0.5g isn‚Äôt compatible for now because I swear 99% of issues posted are about it
Curseforge, or you can compile a build yourself
Also, you might want #eureka, since it‚Äôs the only content addon out for now
Is it latest create?
0.5g doesn‚Äôt work for now because they rewrote their rendering system
Try 0.5e
:thumb:
^
As stated here
What exactly doesn‚Äôt work?
I saw
256x256 chunks
theoretically
yes it would technically work but assembly logic might eat it alive
like what happened with rango's giant flying thing
:Thonk:
most entities work fine on ships
depends on the mod tho
also, fair warning
shouldnt be too long but aight
?
thats extra sussy
can you post your mod list? we havent had that issue
lemme check actually
i have no idea
eclipse temurin
and the ship assembler is a really broken assembly logic version of the ship stick
it also doesnt have a blacklist so you can accidentally assemble the ground
modlist?
also java 17 or java 8
whats your modlist
sure
considering they had exit code 1, i doubt
In clockwork it just makes sense ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
I‚Äôm experienced enough with create‚Äôs codebase to say that
Well
Remember how create has OOP-hell
Ten billion classes for everything
Contraptions are even worse
Contraptions, being the oldest part of create, are also the most messy
Or just mixin bearings and whatnot to replace
We can probably mixin a bearing to make it spawn a vs2 ship instead of a contraption
And just pretend contraption code doesn‚Äôt exist
Also wouldn‚Äôt break addon compat then
Since we wouldn‚Äôt be overriding what a contraption is
Also in clockwork can we please make assembly logic for ships based off glue
I think that would solve all the assembly jank we have rn
as I said, we can just make it not spawn at all
trust me I‚Äôm aware of how interconnected it is
We‚Äôd essentially need to rewrite the bearing class
I‚Äôve messed with contraption code plenty (I wonder why :speen:) and personally I think it‚Äôs doable
It‚Äôs no different from making a custom potato cannon, except hopefully we won‚Äôt need 18 classes to do it
Yes
Fabric version of it is even worse
As some can attest to
Because then it‚Äôs all the spaghetti
Copy pasted into fabric
With a portinglib that is literally just copy pasted forge libraries
It‚Äôs hell
I mean
The thing is that at this point a total rewrite would obliterate all addons
because we‚Äôve all embraced the jank
Then again the create devs have merc‚Äôd addons in the past-
Create: Steam and Rails when create 0.5 dropped be like
(Their entire thing was custom trains like 0.5 and then 0.5 dropped and made their entire mod useless)
the old days where fps over 60 was expected
they do actually
i might be able to get bogeys rendering if i see what fluffy's done so far, assuming they arent workin on it
then again, create fabric's rendering is the worst part of it so idk üíÄ
since 99% of the rendering components are in porting lib
Only half ironic
based
very based triode as usual
on fabric or forge?
on froge, you can force it to load before in mods.toml
can i see your mods toml

that's not how creativity works
creativity works better in boundaries
1.16+ has some of the best mods in the entirety of minecraft's history, the only reason it has less is because it's newer and has never had a solidified mainstay version
1.12 is good, but it has nothing to do with style consistency
it's because of time
if 1.20 drops and mojang takes a year hiatus or so, i can guarantee the modding community will catch up
you can still do crazy shit and stick to a rough minecrafty style
appearance =/= content
???
ah yes, the vanilla minecraft feature where i make flying physics vessels
the vanilla minecraft feature where i automate the world
not like scicraft
walks is talking about how all mods are too vanilla+ now but like
what mods are vanilla plus outside of qol mods
?
read what was said
???
"stick to vanilla + content wise"
i wasnt even responding to you
i was responding to him lmao
this aint hostile
im just confused
the only hostile sentence was "what the hell are you on about" :diesofdeath:

no its called being confused as you ask me what the hell im on about ü§®
i'm not gonna question that cause its more effort than its worth
me go back to making create 0.5g not cause game implosion
mcreator?

because mcreator mods are the definition of lazy
they also are

tpk when you port vs2 to 1.12 I will go against my own morals and make an initial port of takeoff to 1.12
lmfao
did somebody say they need art
whitelist is better
whitelist is what we already have
i think
wait no
we do have a blacklist
im smart
only issue with a whitelist is that mod blocks will be automatically not on it
no good

i disagree wholeheartedly

i may be a create fan but even i wont try to claim create is the "only indepth content mod"
minecolonies :trol:
nah minecolonies is just a worse version of its predecessors
origins, quark, literally any fabric content mod since they didnt exist before 1.14, farmer's delight
off the top of my head
quark 1.12 is hardly a mod
it got almost all its features post 1.12
quark pre-1.13 was essentially the "chest recolorer mod"
they don't even have a feature list for 1.12 on their website anymore
so
my statement stands that the majority exist post 1.13
it has over 117 now
old website had a 1.12 counter
you dont write mixins in kotlin

theyll retract their statement
listen i prefer frog to fbric
but
to say its easier
it's easier for me cause im more familiar with forge
its not easier from an agnostic view
however
forge does have one thing fabric doesnt
and while it makes loading slow
it also means i dont need ten different apis to do what i want to do
if im gonna be adding the bloat back with apis anyways
ill take the ram
i mean yeah
but like
i have 32
so im not really crying over 3

true, however, i simply gesture to what create fabric had to do to work

I cannot spoil anything
not necessarily
there are modes to prevent disassembly
takeoff hinges wont be backported because takeoff probably won't be backported

Oh wait you aren‚Äôt using kotlin at all are you
Regardless just use the custom registry stuff
And ewou probably made it for a reason
Likely
Does not exist
is that just vs control
But bad
@ThatPolishKid99
It‚Äôs very easy
Eureka is basic bitch
I mean vs control is more complicated

Your own addon would be more complex 100%

no rudders tho

When clockwork drops
It‚Äôs gonna be kinda vital to the image of vs2
Because rn people are under the impression that eureka is the limit of vs2
I like eureka don‚Äôt get me wrong I just think it gave a lot of people the wrong impression
I‚Äôm actually working on that
:susie:
Or if you mean for like ships
Nah I meant the vehicle parts

:trol:
The power of farters compels you (for now)
Stare at eureka or takeoff for a bit
It‚Äôs pretty simple
Takeoff has more examples for things applying forces indirectly
Eureka has more examples for control obv
Kotlin is easy
math is the hard part
Forge is only a barrier if you don‚Äôt know how to forge

And I yell at fabric when it can‚Äôt find my Minecraft in my Minecraft
only issue I‚Äôve had with forge is that in r&d for some reason joml took a vacation
Haven‚Äôt figured out why
Nah it‚Äôs a Dev environment issue
Happens when you use the sidebar run client
I‚Äôd say to launch clockwork to see what I mean but :clueless:
Sussy
I‚Äôll take a look later
Still no computer case so still no laptop in school üòî
Top run button seems to have different launch args
It launches fine for me while runclient does not
ye hence why when you tried to runClient (sidebar task) it had the error
Remember
Nah it‚Äôs how I fixed my thing
I was using sidebar runclient
:susie:
Tech‚Äôs forge doesn‚Äôt work
My fabric doesn‚Äôt work
Dueling peaks
I still don‚Äôt know how that happens
Dawg
Let me fix it
I‚Äôll do it in five
Minutes
ü§®
How
Depends
In eureka, I don‚Äôt think so
Another addon
A work in progress
#takeoff
hmm
it depends on the weight of the blocks
get in a seat and hold space
hit c
enables/disables cruise
you might have it enabled on accident
hmm
can i see el ship
ohhh wait  isee why
concrete is heavy as shit
couldnt you replace the concrete of the balloon with balloon blocks
or go into config and increase balloon lifting force
if you wanna keep concrete
they said its rooms
also if its quartz thats definitely heavy
i forgor what the weight values were
they should be on the wiki ngl :clueless:
np gamer
some blocks are heavier
metal blocks are the heaviest iirc
ye
i mean
even netherite was no match for the original takeoff balloons tho
:clueless:

abscond
:clueless:
ruby wants me to make bluperglue
:trol:
i mean
i probably should work on that if i ever want to have vr mechs
only issue is i think vivecraft is like
hell
at least no optifine dependency anymore
i mean you can do it and i can test it
i have a vr headset
it just doesnt render vs ships
thats all
they exist and can be interacted with fine
they just dont appear
im ngl im 99% sure its something small and stupid
cause it doesnt even crash
i
was about to say lol
they might have a custom distance check for like vr headset head
we should try to mixin to that if it exists anyways
is vivecraft open source?
oh it is
https://github.com/ferriarnus/VivecraftMod
oh its all mixins
thats somewhat reassuring
NEVERMIND
I FEAR
https://github.com/ferriarnus/VivecraftMod/tree/Multiloader-1.18/common/src/main/java/jopenvr
you see why i end up getting into 12 different projects
i come up with ideas and people want all of them
andi  have too much pride to leave it to somebody else
the
**clock**
:trol:
in all seriousness
.5g and fabric compat are
very close to done
but they might be a bit
c*ock is ticking
that implies the censored letter is t
ctock is ticking
ehh
rarely
unless you make it "disappear" by activating cruise

wdym by that
R&D is a mod intended for 1.19 but since the main feature is mechs I‚Äôve backported it for my purposes currently
So I second this
It‚Äôs significantly easier
Would take at most a few days
99% of it is import refactoring
The rest is worldgen which vs2 doesn‚Äôt add
Because for some reason mojang likes to change their file structure every update
weather 2 is on 1.18 now :guh:
Ship gets nado‚Äôd
Hooked onto a ship via a poon in the midst of a nado

Ad Astra oxygen does not work with room seals
It‚Äôs an aabb
So yes it needs compat
Unfortunately
No it isn‚Äôt floodfill

:clueless:
It‚Äôs not unfounded
They have a grudge against me I merely return the favor
don‚Äôt join aero
You won‚Äôt gain info you‚Äôll gain brain tumors
All the members of the server do is argue all day and night
I can tell you everything about it
I was their number one fan for like a hot minute
Until they decided to start shitting on me for reasons
The irony of that fact is that I liked Valkyrien warfare but I forgot Valkyrien skies was related so I thought yall were randos
LMFAO
I‚Äôve been in this server longer than you
Simply inactive as shit until recently
I was one of the cringers who used vs1 back when the cannon block was in
Remember that thing
Damn
TPK is the elder
Copper joined in 2020
According to discord
Oh you mean discord account date
My original account is older
I ditched it for this one in 2017

I predate you on discord
Trol
Wait a second
My original account is here
@Cheesemeister
Ye lol
Damn
What was mine
Lemme check my main
I see I‚Äôm just as brain damaged as I was
It has not healed

Wait actually
I was active here before?
I had a period of activity I forgot entirely about
Huh
Weird
It was back in early 2021
I was
Wait
Was I
I don‚Äôt know time
I‚Äôm a senior now, so I was in eighth grade 4 years ago
That feels like eons ago
So no I was a freshman when I joined here
But like still
Oh wait no hold on
It was early in the year
Wouldn‚Äôt that mean it was the previous year of schooling
My brain doesn‚Äôt work well enough to remember that shit
So then yes I was in middle school
Right because my freshman year got cut off from Covid
I remember now
yeah I‚Äôm a senior in hs
Wait was
No what year was
I forgot it was 2023
LMFAO
but yeah
Im not even an adult legally yet
Close but no cigar
Youngest vs2 dev trol
Triode is an ancient sorcerer
Ngl
I always thought AABB stood for the points it used
Don‚Äôt ask
I was stupid
Ruby I joined ten days after you did
On my original account
In some alternate timeline I was actually active here for that entire time
maybe if I was active here instead of the create community I wouldn‚Äôt be so stupid
üòî
LMAO
I inherited the permanent neural damage
Of create
It‚Äôs far worse than here
Better version
that‚Äôs why the average iq is five points lower
And the average iq here is already 4
Also I‚Äôm the youngest vs2 Dev but I‚Äôm like 99% sure half the create addon devs are younger than me
hence why all the addons kinda suck ass
I said average
You bring the number up a bit
I bring it down
You‚Äôre right
Average of 2 iq
Factoring out spider joe lost you two points
Weather 2 in 1.18
:trol:
I like how the announcement for that was literally just plain text at the top of the curseforge page
No fanfare for one of the classic mods getting overhauled totally
I may have claustrophobia but I deal with the crushing pressure of taking on too many projects at once just fine :haha:
Aint nothin gonna break my stride
Plus it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm actively working on all of them at once
I‚Äôm not an octopus
I‚Äôm mostly hyper fixated on mekapi which I can‚Äôt even get working yet cause I‚Äôm waiting on physics objects and mesh colldiers
Speaking of which I haven‚Äôt groveled to triode yet today
I would cry if it drops this weekend
I have a family party on Saturday and 8 hours of work on Sunday
No time to nolife
üòî
Are you trying to trick me into speed running clockwork
Triode actually finished physics objects he‚Äôs just holding out so that I finish clockwork /j
Ransom
MekAPI could theoretically lead to the flans mod of 1.18+
Being able to slap together vehicles easily
Means people could make addons for it without spending seven years
I swear to got
I‚Äôve heard talk of 0.6
And I will cry
In class
No lol
There isn‚Äôt any
Create is just
That prevalent
Plenty of mods didn‚Äôt support ic2
I‚Äôm not too young for ic2
I got into modding when original tekkit was huge
I know buildcraft
Witchery?
Still
Create seems like if a mod doesn‚Äôt have create support
There‚Äôs a murder
Losing my mind
*insert terraria boss1*
You‚Äôre gonna see my mechs and be sad it‚Äôs only on 1.18
:trol:
A week is generous
Wash will be saying 1.18 when after five minutes
Orion drive
The fuck is team rustic 4
agreed
Genuinely don‚Äôt know if triode is joking and that‚Äôs mildly more worrying
Your mother is correct
Lemme spell this out in a language you can understand
If (mother == right) {
uhhh
I honestly forgot all my c the moment you said that
Inconvertible types
You know I‚Äôm not a real mc Dev because I have healthy dietary habits and I work out
Wdym by collision damage
I was gonna implement shitty impact damage for mekapi vehicles using their health system but that‚Äôs not the same as it‚Äôs blocks
Well mechs won‚Äôt ever fully break
They‚Äôll disable
When I punch a mech with another mech
I need to calculate the damage that‚Äôs gonna do to the target mech
And if it will do any at all
Like if a copper little shit mech tries to sock a titanium mech in the arm I feel like it‚Äôll get hurt instead
Well yeah it‚Äôs part of mekapi
My idea is maybe the fist as a damage resistance modifier
So punching something will usually do less damage to the puncher
Than the punched
Unless the armor difference is stupid
Copper mech vs titanium mech is just the standing here meme
https://tenor.com/view/standing-here-i-realize-gif-24728653
Also
Klarkson will be able to take a hit
But don‚Äôt like
Or he‚Äôll break as well
Just like Incredible Hulk him
https://tenor.com/view/hulk-smash-gif-20570882
Oh also
My real main issue with Klarkson is gonna be
Making shit fight back against him
Mechs too
I need to have mobs recognize them as a target
Which I have no idea how to do
I guess I could put an entity inside the ship?
Only half ironic
But yeah the main issue will be mobs fighting back
They may try to hit the player and hit the mech collaterally
But for klarkson
I don‚Äôt know
I fear but sure
I could always stick an invisible entity in klarkson‚Äôs chest that they try to swing at and hit him instead
Hmm
Well there is no shipyard
For klarkson
He‚Äôs a physics object directly
Not a ship
I‚Äôm not entirely sure how that works actually
there‚Äôs no t tho
Shard
Sharded
its getting closer
that would actually be pretty useful
i just don't know how to do it exactly lol
i mean
*looks at mekapi*
soon we wont even be makin ships :trol:
:)
propellors scale proportionately to the amount of sails they have
as in a 3x3 square?
works fine
technically sails are not a full block
ohh
encased fan
thats not exactly create styled :clueless:
it acts like a small propellor essentially
tiny thing
but like
obviously
yes
that would be the solution there
propellors are significantly more efficient
but they require minimum 3x3 space
because even if you have a 1x3 prop
it has to spin in a 3x3 space
well forces would also get scaled down :clueless:
also that stupid spinup thing i did took forever to get working correctly
fuck create rotation speed
LMFAO
its not a static animation, its actually updating the speed of the prop
so like the stress requirement rises and such
its also smooth speed updates in general, so if you lower the input speed (or cut it off with a clutch like in the clip) it will slow down or speed up in response
yes
ships can be resized
there's also bearings that can spin the wheels themselves now tho
also it used create to move weights to turn the wheels
which was actually genius
the power of a physics engine my friend
the sky is quite literally not the limit
its in the creative inventory
use the stick not the thing with no texture
id recommend using the takeoff hinge as it actually saves
SHIT I FOROGT
i really need to set that up rq
hold on
i just gotta steal eureka's stuff for it
:clueless:
oh wait i have to
:diesofdeath:
shouldnt be too difficult
correct
speaking of krunch
because i probably should've had it like that from the get go
i mean all the other vs2 addons do
so its officially maintained when i do it on clockwork but not officially maintained when i do it on takeoff smh my hea
twas a joke
easy as shit to add
integration
compat will be in base vs2
further integration will be in cockwork
i mean clockwork
i mean c*ockwork
wdym by prop pitch
no i mean items specifically designed for create and vs2
guh
ye
like trains on ships
ye
trains dont work in base vs2 yet cause compat still a wip
but soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
^^^
spoken like a true tuber
more like 3/4ths
the stuff that doesnt work is mostly minor things
well idk if trains are minor but shh
i genuinely have used trains like twice so :clueless:
thats another fix we did
nah
currently the compat mixins are stored in clockwork
but theyll be moved to base vs2
when they done
physically cant do that with create contraptions
could do it with a vs2-ified contraption but even then it seems very sus
:3dsus:
so true
in 2 weeks i will explode because triode will finish lod
and i will be 1 step closer
to mekapi
nah
:clueless:
vs2 mechs be  like

wdym
is a mod
create R&D
its my mod :susie:
lmfao
fair lmfao
not like there's been a ton of visible development to remind anyone
üíÄ
in my defense we were doing things, our mechs just turned out like shit repeatedly
we decided on vs2 after realizing that normal mc entities werent cutting it
correct
and worse
we had to use :vomit: geckolib
for the animations
so it was all clientsided
meanwhile with physics entities
your mech can topple
can sumo wrestle another mech
can-
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999650393791402014/1045852524478988378/shadow_realmed.mp4
this is what copper is going to do to klarkson
he is a stark advocate of klark abuse
ü§®
üì∏
but yeah r&d is essentially my passion project for the last like half a year and itll finally get somewhere once physics entities are possible
no longer must i rely on minecraft to handle things
but i can make it a shipyard entity so it can rotate so no biggie
:clueless:
nah its krunch
so itll run like butter
unless you have like 50 mechs all bodyslamming eachother
ye good ping may be required
but thats a small price to pay
for
lmfao
mic
you arent fooling me
i let you corrupt my brain with takeoff
clockwork shall remain simple
save it for mekapi vehicles
:clueless:
so a mech running on aeronautics :clueless:
LMFAO
wouldnt be possible anyways
as far as we know aero doesnt support generic physics objects
speaking of generic physics objects
if ruby or triode do not work on them
i will figure it out myself
:3drevenge:
lame
cringe
unbased
me want mesh collider
me figure out mesh collider
me will be contribution to team
thanks :D
my style is heavily create based
i can send like one clockwork model lol
the propellor
since we've shown it
lemme grab it


yes
gotta stick with create style
oh also the clip shared in the clock channel is of a slightly bugged build
and they do somewhat
they do not render tho
and i have no idea why‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
the redstone arrow indicates the direction its providing thrust and an airstream towards
the propellors use any sail capable block
they have rules actually
a minimum requirement
that would be advised
as the corners of the propellor are taken into account
aero is not part of my design philosophy
:3drevenge:
well thats how fans work
they are mini props
essentially
limitation of a create contraption unfortunately
wash you misunderstand how much create contraptions suck ass
it took me a full day to get the propellor to
change speed up smoothly
it slowed down smoothly perfectly fine
but yet
for speeding up
it was jagged and shit
well yeah
i
triode will b e mad at me for spoiling but idc
cause im the one making it anyways
there's a wrench that works like the create wrench, the Socketwrench
it turns a contraption into a vsified contraption
and vice versa
not necessarily
i think there was talk of adding create contraption collision shapes to a vs ship already
its more it makes it interactable
and also lets you subcontraption
hold on i have a thing of the vsified top somewhere
gotta fish it up
will work like a propellor
but vs
i say will because the socketwrench may not be for a while
its kinda the hardest part lol
the rest of the addon is easy just time consuming and frustrating
because Create‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

funny vs-ified top
no fugly ass glue texture tho
we will have an SU producing solution for smaller craft but no spoiles
yeah
no more c*ocks leakin
:diesofdeath:
they will
they'll be somewhere in between vs1 rudders and complex wings
valkyriu- i mean, levitite
:clueless:
it should have stayed there
along with the fuckin rudders
:susie:
listen rudders are funny but fundamentally broken
we can do better
it was funny yes but like
it doesnt even make go up
it just
stays there
its literally a block based eureka stabilizer
i liked valkyrium ore a lot actually
not cause the texture but because
block flying away from you when you mine it
is hilarious
takeoff is STILL
impossible to make a ship with
because i have not added a single way to stop the balloons from stratosphering you
listen clockwork keeps dragging me in
and then
when i am done wtih clockwork
ventities will be done
and i will disappear again
to work on mekapi
gotta love the tilt sensor that doesnt update before you're already 10 degrees in the wrong direction
so precise
i mean an axle in the middle is what a turret ring boils down to
they work fine already
just projectile bug that
hasnt bene fixed
it isnt a cbc specific thing
for some reason projectiles just decide they dont wanna reorient
and we've kinda left it alone
triode is too busy working on new lod
no all projectiles are broke ruby
cbc works fine
projectiles fired from ships dont
create big cannons
probably should considering its causing even dispensers and stuff to break
yes
this chat moves too fast for me to be coherent
okay so essentially ruby
renders fine everything
can i
finish pls
issue is it has a bias towards its original direction
doesnt matter the source
so its not a CBC issue and its probably not a dispenser issue either
they arent being ejected from the shipyard correctly
eject sus
it is
different bug
from my understanding, yes
but the rotation isn't getting applied correctly
i am gonna step away cause me cannot finish sentence
i dont possess the lightspeed drive typing speed
vs2 github
also
they are similar but one is rendering and one is position transforms
well yeah its facing the original direction of the ship
thats just an indicator that rotation broke
not that its the same exactissue
i know what issue is being described, ill make a report
nah it happens on beta 8 too afaik
which is latest
boom
issue report made
@Rubydesic
the render one is a bit confusingly explained to me but i can try and replicate it myself and then describe it
essentially any projectile
the projectiles are put into the real world correctly
but the rotation of the ship isnt applied
shouldnt be too hard to fix i dont think
and then people wont complain about cbc cannons not working :clueless:
cause i fixed the rest of the cannon stuff
they load and fire and render fine
just wrong direction pensive
üòî
yeah its a lot of minor beta bugs that people get pissy over
ohhh its a raytrace
thats not related to projectiles at all
but
thats also an easy fix
i think
yes because its the front of the ship
look at the first image
they're hovering over one waypoint
and its selecting one off to the right
standing broke
seated fine
very
mega sus
known issue
if the ship is destroyed the seat has nowhere to go
except the shipyard
and it punts  you off thee
because if you jump you keep ship momentum
for a short moment
so
sussy
like how I can‚Äôt see V-entities as anything but vent
Vent sus
:3dsus:
We really need a better name
For physics entities
Calling them physics entities confuses them with mc entities
Which they aren‚Äôt
Calling them ventities is sus
And same issue
That doesn‚Äôt solve it
It‚Äôs still easy to confuse
Can‚Äôt use the word entity
Thingamajigs
Too generic
^
clearly he‚Äôs made of pillows
For maximum hugs
VSolid
well softbodies are still solid
They aren‚Äôt liquids
Landlord term for a constrained ship
It‚Äôs a COCK object clearly
LMFAO
:trol:
They mean attaching a ship to your player
No they mean attaching a ship to your player lol
That Ryan stole from me
:clueless:
I suggested using worldshells as cybernetics
And Ryan said ‚ÄúWELL ACTUALLT IVE WANTED TO DO THAT SO NO I WILL DO THAT‚Äù
Mekapi is all about abusing constraints to their limits
So it‚Äôd be a good place for it probably
can‚Äôt wait to have to redo the entire api when constraints get redone to be serialized
:clueless:
I don‚Äôt even know how we got to this point ngl
I‚Äôm still getting strung along in a conversation
No I genuinely don‚Äôt
I haven‚Äôt been driving this
yes
We will make stupid shit
In the name of funny
The mechs in r&d are called Mekas
It was only natural
Also Jesus I missed five seconds and 50 messages
Very rare
fair warning about create
tech
do not go into it unshielded
create is a wasteland of garbage messy code
it took me actual days to make a *propellor spin up smoothly*
without even doing anything but trying to get the game to accept the math
they are notoriously hard wired as well
every class is tied into every other class
you have to use their registries just for create stuff to recognize your stuff
thing is
aero took like
7 months to do that
so im still in the lead by math
someone was workin on it
enough aero speak anyways
not the point
we talkin bout create
12
nah jk
its at like
2:30
honestly the only reason R&D is even a create addon is because i like the visual style
ngl
dont insult 1.12 in front of tpk
its his kingdom
and i have too much pride to redo my models to make them not create related
i like them too much
emotionally attached to klarkson
thats cap
exactly why i absorbed it
i have become a master of the create artstyle through sheer brute force
technically i improved the create artstyle
i have adapted almost every color palette
to be more expansive
because by default create's color palettes are limited
would it be wrong to say that is unironically
my biggest pet peeve
with 1.12
but like
mo bends exists if i really hate myself
thing is
it doesnt stop me from using 1.12
for the far better mods
i cannot give up ichun mods
im sorry
forge also runs fast with the right mods
it just doesnt load fast
:trol:
we should simply make a better minecraft
fuck it
chiselcreate
isnt that like every game
incorrect
very incorrect
because spigot is a mod
spigot is a mod by definition
and therefore 99% of servers are modded
if mods were banned spigot would be too
its like a tsunami wave
java has like 10%
of the total playerbase
because 90% are all kids on their pa pah's pahone
with a cracked screen
what the fuck did you just say
no genuinely
what did you just say
?
they are playing the game
and enjoying it
how is this turning into minecraft is boring
:guh: the children dislike being loners and like socialization
no way
impossible
bro i dont play any multiplayer game unless its with my friends
bro you play the game for the experience of playing the fuckin game
go back to your plasma engines my friend
nah im kiddin
thats actually just untrue
like flat out
untrue
bedrock has underwater redstone
i rest my case
this is like going to a 50s suburb and asking what they're voting for
we're as biased as humanly possible
ah yeah lemme quickly make a vs2 bedrock port
with the nonexistant modding capabilities
someone was actually trying to make bedrock create
fun fact
it uh
hold on lemme find it
we actually are
fuckin backwards
the outside addon dev quit :trol:
the bedrock create thing
even works with vs2
natively
which is insane
considering the 1.12.2 shidding are  you surprised theyre new to modding
that is true
bedrock runs well
very well
i joined in the beta days
good times
do i rememeber like any of the beta days? no lol i was like 6 years old and mentally damaged
but
it was funny
thats how you know someone has not truly experienced <=1.12 modded
i have
forge modloader overrated
return to modifying version jar
make sure its obfuscated too
so you cant fuckin read it
mekanism :diesofdeath:
i was only pretending to have brain damage
hot take for some of you
mekanism is mid
as hell
mekanism is OP
its cool but incredibly overpowered
mekasuit agming
casually be completely fuckin invincible
okay maybe i cant speak considering im making 22 foot tall mechs
but like
:clueless:
^^^ this
it cannot peacefully coexist
its like the lead brain parasite
you speak such words under this roof
begone
for ten thousand years
ive never had fewer frames in minecraft than a fully operational power flower
reminds me
@TechTastic we gotta add power armor to mekapi
nah bro
i played on a 2011 imac
fear me
you're describing the average 2005 pc
i dont see the issue
my imac was about equivalent to a
1998 ms dos
in computing power
i thin roughly
:clueless:
/j
ignore the fact that
ms dos isnt from 1998
its an operating system not at type of computer
and none of that sentence made sense
we dont talk about it
my guy ms dos is a command line os
its an OS
its running speed is not
rigid
tied to the hardware
andrupka gaming
natively too
actually tho
and its only gonna get better
new lod approaching
add vsbodies
to that list
so mekapi
what
clockwork is like a few weeks of work at most ngl
honestly a lot of clockwork stuff just needs me to get off my lazy ass and model it
the only model ive made that i can share is the 15 minute propellor bearing i made
ye but the create style is literally my motif
wouldnt have made the mechs if i didnt
i just dont have the spark for clockwork ngl
feels too simple so my brain just bounces off
therei sno rigging
its partials
i dont wanna go completely "my style" tho because its meant to fit in with base create
and while the mech is certainly create esque
i think clockwork is intended to look like it was a direct extension of create
Custom glue type
Bluperglue
It grabs onto normal glue but normal glue doesn‚Äôt grab it
Create style is my style now
Deal with it
Cope even
Here‚Äôs my viewpoint:
If you want a concise, clean, and accurate addon to vs2 for create
With a polished aesthetic and officially maintained repo
Clockwork is for you
But I will be over here in my meth lab melting down jolly ranchers
And pouring them into the rough shape of mechs
For r&d
I salute you good sir
But yeah essentially
Clockwork will be the refined create addon
#takeoff :trol:
so true
And it‚Äôll work too because since all the compat mixins will be in base vs2
No mixin conflicts between r&d and clockwork
Guess you could say it‚Äôll
Work like c
How to show off physics engine:
Step 1: Build beautiful small aircraft with well placed gyroscopes balloons and propellors
Step 2: ***IT‚ÄôS TIME TO FACE YOUR FEEAAAR-*** Bodyslam a mech into it from above
We call this maneuver the anti-eureka stabilizer
*crashes a ten ton mech into a tiny wood floater*
I had like 11 pings
What did I miss
I forgot liftoff existed when naming it and now it‚Äôs a source of confusion to people I tell about it :clueless:
There was r&d discussion?
I‚Äôll search it in a bit lol
Actually, that‚Äôs not a hinge
It is a create propellor
Not entirely
They‚Äôd have to support doing things only contraptions do
I spent a solid few days on it
I‚Äôm proud of how it turned out but it‚Äôs a bit
Jank
Automatically picking up items, blueprint printing with deployers, special part interactions that only occur on contraptions
Otherwise it‚Äôd be a downgrade to vs-ify something
It‚Äôs always jank
that defeats the point of making all contraptions vs-ifiable
Ye but if they don‚Äôt act like contraptions
A lot of farms rely on contraptions auto picking stuff up
Ye but what if your point is to abuse a chain of farms
Can‚Äôt do that except for one on the end
Fair
The propellors are 100% create
Just with my funny propellor math to update their speed smoothly
And I‚Äôm not gonna lie
I don‚Äôt remember how
It was supposed to just be startup and shutdown
But I somehow made everything interpolate
Nono it has a point
You see stress is tied to speed
And the stress will actually update as it speeds up
Smoothly
also when overstressed the propellor does not instantly shut down
Rather it will slow down and give you a chance to restart it
yes
Very special
Also it jittered on startup for the longest time
And the solution ended up being something stupid
Is this startup hood on I don‚Äôt remember what video this was

sending it
thank
But yeah as you can see
For some reason it just shat itself starting up for forever
Turns out I had to save the input speed as a seperate variable in the block
Send it to the block entity
And then force it to remember it
Cause for some reason the create kinetic network doesn‚Äôt constantly update
:3dsus:
I really should set up a kofi for models
Probably would be a good income source
might do it today I‚Äôm free after all
:diesofdeath:
I have a question
What do y‚Äôall think a fair rate for a model is
I know it depends on complexity but I will 100% undersell myself
Because last time I did a commission
I charged 10 bucks
And spent 12 hours on it
Ye
It was a 2d art commission
Blockbench
Because I hate myself
Ye
Yeah
I tend to underestimate time to money
That actually works
Damn
That‚Äôs kinda fuckin cool
Ye but it‚Äôs like smooth
Isn‚Äôt drifty what you want
No
Definitely out of scope
R&D might :trol:
should work
i see no reason why not
so mekapi + R&D :trol:
also you might wanna learn kotlin too
i think my kofi is done mostly
just gotta update my pfp and background
because models
and i dont trust myself to handle commissions manually
:clueless:
id rather have a website middleman handle it cause even if it takes a cut like
bet
rn
wish.com aeronautics üíÄ
someone was continually saying that vs2 doesnt support create
even after i said "i am literally vs2 dev, yes it does"
max
your evil counterpart
correct
nah their bad takes agree with aero
so they wouldnt get called out in aero
yes unfortunately
and its a somewhat scuffed solution
it only does because i nut kick it into cooperating
and doing so desyncs the shaft on the bearing block from the shafts of the network
small price to pay for cool factor tho

bruh
i forgot they banned all discussion of vs2
in aero
almost like its because they know they're in the wrong
and coping
there is no generalizing
in create
it does not exist
id have to mixin and rewrite the entire bearing class and thats just a no
thatd break so much
no way to
bott you're smudged again
:CleaningUp:
correct
its a bit of math and janky
and right now there's a bug
where if you use a clutch to kill all rotspeed of a propellor
and then attempt to shut it down
it accelerates to lightspeed
smh
honestly
mixins will be done relatively soon
using a mechanical thingamabober that i forgot the name of
you can set the exact angle of a bearing
but like
beyond that
create is not exactly precise
well technically you can get precision in whole number degrees with said mechanical thing
but like
is not very precise
create with cannons is already known to be imprecise
have you seen cbc
cbc is almost impossible to aim
it actually takes 9 years
i could make a hyperprecision bearing
one meant to be tuned to very precise angles
well no
shipyard conflicts
lmfao
its something to think about for sure
but create is not precise
and never will be perfectly
it has too much jank at really precise angles
cant handle it
no
on a code level
it is full of floats
everything in create is a float
no
oh for like a vs bearing
well maybe
maybe i could make like a seated turret thing
but seems non-clockwork scope
ill consider something like that for R&D since people keep asking me to add cannons as anti mech weapons, but clockwork from what i understand is not a warfare addon
it's just utilities for making ships with create
here's the thing
vs clockwork is not like aero
and as such it wont be getting piles on piles of content
itll probably be the most polished addon out for a while
but its very much going to be like
batshit with no quality control is my motif
aka takeoff and r&D
to be fair a tilt speed and height sensor would not be hard
since you can get all that data from the ship
and just
spit it out
tech did that but for compooter
just ask null
erased
yes
because redstone sucks ass
it is for create's usual purposes
but maybe it's just create being funky
because create rotation tends to shit the bed when trying to be decimal prceise
then yeah its create funkiness
lua is the easiest language
i dare to say
even more than pyshit
scratch isnt a language
it uses another language
just with code blocks over it
honestly scratch in minecraft when
might hop on too
depends
i kinda want to model something rn

lmfao
in all seriousness i would model but i dont typically do blender models and they're a lot harder so
i have a question
why is everything negative to you lambo
let people have their fun :3drevenge:
what the fuck did i miss
this will be washwater
but the water changes will be more than visual
:clueless:
vs2ber
mekapi
:trol:
mekapi is about vehicles with physics entities
it‚Äôs not only mechs they‚Äôre just the main attraction
We will make our own immersive vehicles
Mek api isn‚Äôt ships
It‚Äôs physics entities
It‚Äôll be out of models
That‚Äôs my intention
mekapi is meant to be library that I stuff with as much ventity vehicle presets and references as possible to make other addons have an easier time throwing them together
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing tho
:clueless:
r&d mechs are gonna use it remember
They‚Äôre the definition of modular
that would be sick
Noted :trol:
Stardust really is gonna be the culmination of all the addons efforts aint it
Honestly I wonder if there‚Äôs anything I can do to get a head start on mekapi since I‚Äôm not able to fully start it until new lod and ventities
And mesh collider
lmfao
Oh wait I have an idea
I can‚Äôt use proper physics entities yet but maybe I can work on the IK algorithm for mechs using ships constrained
le funny IK maths
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be super difficult but that‚Äôs famous last words territory right there
?
There was no mention of aero
Oh lmao cope ig
We don‚Äôt care
lmfao
ah i see what it was
Someone took tech‚Äôs message out of context
someone asked tech about the aero drama and he explained it
Then someone in the aero server posted it as if we‚Äôre still hung up on the drama
When someone literally asked
it‚Äôs not spies
People can be in multiple discords
Lmao
They just want beef with us so desperately that they will pull anything out to use as argument material
It‚Äôs what they do
I‚Äôm not entirely sure why
When the clock strikes twelve
the clock channel
Wdym the red one
:diesofdeath:
No
Red in this case is minute hand
The black is the hour
The red is only to distinguish because it‚Äôs small
Well second hands are typically red
On a clock
Ye but can‚Äôt fit a 3 pointer in an emoji
Each time major progress is made the clock is pushed 30 minutes
Right now it‚Äôs at 2:30
A long way to go
nah aero is probably further off
:Thonk:
that would be absolutely hilarious
you can do that
thats the whole point of constraints
MekAPI needs a channel /hj
just so we can collect all these ideas in one place
rather than tossing them around seven different channels
R&D has a whole ass discord tho
also it's kind of its own thing even if it is a vs2 addon technically
mekapi is far more of a "definitively vs2" thing
ye
i dunno if he's busy
but @Triode
i did suggest a separate addon server a while ago but that seems equally messy
so lod cant kill triode but channel recursion can
noted
#mekapi requires the mekapi role but only i have the mekapi role :Thonk:
my echo chamber :clueless:
and fluffy has it too for some reason
:Thonk:
man dont got the mekapi patented role
@Triode
:Gun_But_Better:
its the only display image for vs2 actually
on curseforge
yee
shooting a beacon through two things

i dont think its actually that clamplicated
rather shrimple even
since you can get the world position of a block on the ship easily
i really need to get takeoff packages set up
i also need to make a tally of how many times i say that
was too busy working on a super cool impulse decision for clockwork today
:clueless:
when its done its gonna be
quite cackle worthy id say
Too bad you can‚Äôt laser things with them
This made me laugh far too hard at 11:47
The vs logo itself is low quality /j
As it turns out
Australia is actually just hell
Their prime minister is clearly satan
And what other realm would have nightmare beasts or spider seasons
Cause it was
The visual memetic agent was wearing off
You were starting to feel the brimstone
Aloha
Just watched it
Absolutely badass
also the mech punch was perfectly timed
and that ending cutscene of the vs2 logo was insane
Mega based
Like actually
Nah fuck that I‚Äôll put it in news
They‚Äôll never match the vs2 ensemble anyways :clueless:
Krunch is too powerful
Nah because we already had 1.19
Development hell
And to be honest it‚Äôs art style is too detailed to me
And I dislike that
If you‚Äôre gonna be detailed don‚Äôt keep it voxel
It wouldn‚Äôt be
because it‚Äôs made by hypixel
Which is owned by riot games
And anything made by riot games
is
League of Legends, Valorant
Both of those games are
:guh:
And I wouldn‚Äôt doubt their predatory monetization features would worm their way into hytale
As someone who‚Äôs been down the rabbit hole of league
Absolutely
They charge like full price indie game for a single skin
Parry this, and you will live
He a little slow
Don‚Äôt worry
No more sussy!
No more impostor
No more 19 dollar amogus card

motherfucker committed a thought crime
Alright start pissposting instead
:clueless:
I need to finish the suspicious block
Vs2 runs scarily smooth
0.5 and 0.3.2
Are too different
Clockwork would be an entirely different mod
:3drevenge:
But yeah c*ockwork is 1.18 only because create 0.5 is a vastly different mod from create 0.3.2
Ewou is still stuck in the time when
He used !! In everything
And corrupted worlds
:clueless:
you just have that art
I‚Äôve been in the server almost as long as Ruby on my original account
Like 10 days after
@Cheesemeister
Rango you are gonna appreciate what I‚Äôm working on
speaking of what im working on
i gotta go back to do that
that will also be fixed with what im working on
üòâ
yes because blu
well yeah but this avoids that
hold on go to c*ockwork rq
yes
we are phsics tek mo
also those properties would be useful for other things too
0.3.2 has bare minimum compat
flywheel changes all block entities
thats why
it might be because a lot of stuff in A&B is modified
its not raw create
or raw any of the mods actually
will soon
compat being worked on for fabric and forge
@Rango I know you‚Äôre old, so
it‚Äôs the Valkyrien warfare physics infuser :3
But with a major glow up
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/882856335249657896/1061819837615181896/physics_infuser.gif
This is what I was talking about when I said I was working on a vw reference
Spent all day on the stupid partials and about 30 minutes on the pulse
As it turns out, a pulse like that is very well documented ~~and contained in a bunch of open source libraries~~
I like flair
If you couldn‚Äôt tell by

Exactly
On that note
l a n d
Also the speed of the pulse will match the ground it has to cover
So a small ship will have a slow ripple
While a large ship will be more like this
we like to style here
And for people who don‚Äôt wanna wait out the zapping animation like if they‚Äôre in a rush
Clicking on it while it‚Äôs assembling auto triggers the slam
No that one was copper
He pointed it out LMAO
A few more things:
collecting around the core
I tried to add them
I space out and come to 5 hours later with poorly written code and some cool visual effect
So I can relate
:goosemath:
takeoff isn‚Äôt create related
I think he means create liftoff
Ahh
Takeoff is gonna have packages soonish to download
Haven‚Äôt set them up yet
And the tally strikes 7
Yeah you can grab the source code from #takeoff-updates
No I was just too busy working on #clockwork-üïö
Also the clock moved forward another 30 minutes üò≥
we are slowly making our way closer
Oh there will be something for that
effective-design.com
Real
Definitely no spoilers there sorry
Lips are sealed
Ask a create mod user
Their brain experienced it already
The joke is that 90% are damaged üíÄ
Clockwork
Integrates vs2 with create
Unrelated to eureka
Eureka is essentially just a tech demo mod- it‚Äôs not the entirety of vs2
0.5g is supported soon
We got it working we‚Äôre just polishing the compat
But clockwork won‚Äôt be required for compat
Ye
Including create fabric compat
Nah it isn‚Äôt but it won‚Äôt get active updates for a while
Once vs2 full release drops for 1.18 it will get a back port
But then it will stay and we‚Äôll move on
Floaters do float
Huh
Buoyancy fucked totally then
Cause wood floats
Very sussy
Ah
They are in the water right
Latest GitHub packages is busted iirc
The vvvvvvrrrr. Thuthunk

Man is massive
Despite being 7 blocks tall
:clueless:
‚ÄúYeah, mission control, I can‚Äôt see shit‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòget over it‚Äô‚Äù
‚ÄúI get we need radiation shielding out in space but could you not have like- added a window‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you *mean* it‚Äôs safer this way, I‚Äôm flying blind- what if I hit an as-‚Äú
*connection terminated*
Sound physics got patched in 1.18
I have to make one
I‚Äôve got a whole lot to do
Lmao
Clockwork
Take a gander at me and fluffy‚Äôs hard work
That‚Äôs the physics infuser
On this note, All vs2 addons will be inter-compatible hopefully so any mix of them will work
Then you‚Äôd have a clockwork airship with eureka stabilization
You can already do that with takeoff and eureka
There is no such thing as a clockwork ship or eureka ship
They are all ships
Just forces being applied
Eureka helms have a constant stabilization force they apply to the ship
Which is why it‚Äôs stable
The Physics Infuser is technically a helm
In the assembly sense
Ye
There will be a way to control a ship in clockworks with wasd but it won‚Äôt be via directly applying forces to the ship
Like the control seat will be a block that outputs rotation or whatever which then lets you use that for your purposes
There will be no direct control inputs
It‚Äôll be whatever you build it as
There will be a showcase of the limits of control soonish üòâ
Just uhh give me a few days :trol:
Some people would like to fly their plane without a ti84 calculator at the helm
The chad energy required for a true vs vessel
Ahoy ye Mateys!
When clockwork is out I will 100% host a server with some cheesy role elements to it
Because I want to man a mighty vessel with a hearty crew damnit
‚ÄúAye captain, dogs spotted off of starboard!‚Äù
Wings
the lift
THEY WISH TO STEAL OUR GOLD
It will be eventually
Since stardust plans to use immersive portals for its space travel
It‚Äôs not rn
And ships can‚Äôt pass through immersive portals yet
It will happen tho
Requirement for stardust
Idk
Ohp back to math for me
I live
The urge to write a shitty Valkyrien skies sea shanty rises
And I have no idea why
It would be a total waste of time

nyoom
Had to take a physics test
But since I could not use my phone after I finished
I may or may not have written said shitty shanty I mentioned before for the people invested in the high seas here :trol:
It‚Äôs not compatible ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Lmfao
Nah but then it might mistake people calling vs2 a physics mod
lmfao
Imma send it in off topic
Scroll box is fixed in cw
Physics mod is closed source and paid
We couldn‚Äôt be compat if we wanted to
They have to do the compat
Ahh
Well then no issue
Do note that vs ships won‚Äôt move like boats on the waves
As the waves aren‚Äôt real
They‚Äôre a shader trick
They are purely clientsided and visual
They do not actually exist as anything to the server
So the ship will not be moved by them
They‚Äôre essentially just a very fancy shader that only applies to water
Or boats in water
Shaders aren‚Äôt just lighting
It‚Äôs essentially just a rendering trick
Aka, unfortunately no ships on beating waves
Washwater will be for that /j
Nah not that kind of shader
Shader is a vast term
Technically the infuser pulse is a shader
It doesn‚Äôt actually move the mobs
Just looks like it does
For the server, it‚Äôs as if they don‚Äôt exist
Only the client thinks they do
BSL
Or complementary
Both run good
Huh weird
They run fine for me
Overkill admittedly lmao
All you need to know is my performance is probably not a good reference point
:susie:
You cannot peer pressure me
Despite your attempts :Gun_But_Better:
You were using igpu?
Why the hell would you
Why did you put it in an ai
They can‚Äôt sing it if you don‚Äôt give them the right tune
Plus they‚Äôre probably expecting to sing in 4/4
A shanty is a swing rhythm
It‚Äôs 3/4
I happen to have a saxophone and a piano
:trol:
Unfortunately I have no shanty instruments
Well I might have a harmonica
But that‚Äôs more Wild West
WAIT NO
I have a comically small guitar
I don‚Äôt know how to play it though
Because it‚Äôs like tiny
Boutta learn over the weekend so I can play this shanty :trol:
We need a group to sing it so we can get the proper shanty vibe
Lmfao
You mustn‚Äôt care for quality
The energy put into a shanty is all that matters
you think the pirates on the open seas could join an opera?
Don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt
I like the bottom left actually
It will run but it‚Äôll not be super stable since aternos servers kinda suck
Nothing in life is free
And if it is
Don‚Äôt trust it
I use bisect
Ye happens
Unfortunately it makes vs2 kinda sussy with entities following ships :diesofdeath:
also had someone‚Äôs villagers evacuate through the floor of their airship
Wdym
Ahh
Chair entity isn‚Äôt a shipyard entity
Easy compat
Just gotta slap those in
I wonder if it‚Äôs possible to auto add any entity with ‚Äúchair‚Äù or ‚Äúseat‚Äù in its id to the shipyard entity list @Rubydesic
The only problems I could see is if an entity is named chair and then not actually a chair for some reason
Most mods are compatible unless stated otherwise or if they change rendering a whole lot
Create big cannons
Blocky siege
clockwork must add cannons then
Lmfao
Would anyone complain if I just add a bunch of ‚Äúpeacekeeping utilities‚Äù to clockwork :trol:
High explosives
CBC is too complex for my small brain so I‚Äôd probably make a more user friendly cannon if I add one to clockwork
Also they are near impossible to use properly
Seat controlled cannon :Thonk:
Sea of thieves it
I mean next what, a harpoon launcher to grab onto another ship?
Then we‚Äôll really be sea of thieves
The most small arms I‚Äôd add would be a flintlock pistol that shoots literal flint
TPK we have like 5 rn
We can afford to have 6
buzzkill
My guy
I made the infuser in a day
??
I‚Äôm
I‚Äôm not working on them all at once
Clockwork takes priority
I‚Äôm well aware
And I‚Äôve been working on clockwork for two weeks so it‚Äôs a tad late to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take on another project‚Äù
I mean like
Adhd grindset, agreed
Hold on uploading video to prove my point but data shit it‚Äôll be a minute
*insert impatient finger tapping* data please

Wait
That wasn‚Äôt even the right thing
I‚Äôm a genius
Perfect
So anything named SeatEntity gets added to shipyard
Ez
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt believe so
Lasagna lib properties /j
?
Wdym
Wdym by ‚Äúanything to do with me‚Äù
Potato Battery
plumbum
my funky addon
That triode and dust commandeered
It‚Äôs a propulsion addon
But also like
More
It‚Äôs something
lmfao
And it‚Äôs also on the backburner while I work on clockwork
No but you can‚Äôt believe the restraint I am applying to not make clockwork a mascot
Like
It is taking all my willpower
I‚Äôve been told that by everyone
If I was allowed to you already know it‚Äôd be another clockwork automaton :clueless:
Nah it‚Äôs fine I just don‚Äôt get phased by it
Fazed?
Idk what word
Klarkson sitting at a desk with a pair of old man glasses and a pen is the new feature of R&D
Taxson
Correct
Shart
Thanks autocorrect
Shart shader
No
Research and Development
Someone is Working on that I think
R&D is a vs addon now so it can be added to the pile
As well as MekAPI

1.19 more like 19 hours of chunkloading
Mechs are gonna be mekapi vehicles
Mekapi is gonna use VSBodies / physics objects to make vehicles
Essentially
Fully simulated mechs
I want to add armor and piercing so I wouldn‚Äôt mind some help
:clueless:
After all some of ya are gonna want tanks
And what‚Äôs a tank without a scarily accurate damage model
That gets us assassinated
I have 500
I will not settle for world of tanks lookin asses
:3drevenge:
It‚Äôs ammo rack or bust
Yes
I have experienced true funny
That being
A Daimler mk2
Getting shot by a massive tank
And having so piss shit armor
The round went through and didn‚Äôt detonate
And I lived
>shoots a copper mech with armor piercing
>it just dips and doesn‚Äôt detonate
‚ÄúHey what the fuck‚Äù
The copper mech is gonna be the Daimler of mechs
LMAO
will be sick tho actually
And not too far off from getting started
New lod and vsbodies are all we‚Äôre waiting on
nice
except with MECHS
I don‚Äôt count bapril hools
smh
I doubt r&d will be the only mod to use mekapi mechs
But it will be the main one
Since like

Just look at it
Tier 1 mechs don‚Äôt have armor plating
Only exclusion is the iron meka
Since it‚Äôs the tank class
I mean the tier 2 endurance meka is literally called ‚Äúplated brass‚Äù lmao
actually it‚Äôs create logic
brass is pretty decently strong
I mean idc
They can talk about what they want over there
It‚Äôs irrelevant to us
And also I was in the middle of a conversation
:Gun_But_Better:
Wash have you seen the meka tierlist
Ye brass is at least post diamond because you need to go to the nether to get it (assuming you don‚Äôt lava bucket a portal)
Ah hold on
https://discord.com/channels/244934352092397568/1051637949235728394/1060340912611401738
I would add a third tier but like
That‚Äôs even more models
And the brass meka model took me 20 hours
so
and I‚Äôm doing it alone
Mostly because I don‚Äôt trust others to keep in the vein of my artstyle
üòî
The andesite meka is literally a wind up toy
we wanted to add a steampunk version of the
Trousers from Wallace and gromit
https://tenor.com/view/wallace-wrong-trousers-out-of-control-panic-wallace-and-gromit-gif-11667955
Klarkson takes command and starts forcing you to craft jars of peanut butter
Simply port it
Nerd
ahh
They‚Äôre incompat for now
Compat will come eventually
Stardust may accelerate it
Yes, but we don‚Äôt like to rehash flawed ideas
:trol:
Depends on what you mean by work
:Thonk:
Ye certain blocks are on a blacklist
Config
do you know how to access mod configs?
Main menu, go to mods
Click on eureka
Hit config
üëç
Man forgets cloth config is literally a requirement
üíÄ
Unfortunately contraptions colliding with the solid world is not something we plan to add
Because that would break a lot of machines that rely on stuff like
Bearings clipping
However
:clueless:
vsified rope pulleys would technically use an actual rope chain tho
Rather than using the static model
rope pulleys with rope constraint chains yes
every ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è create machine will be vs-ifiable
With two exceptions
You won‚Äôt be able to vsify any custom create contraptions, like cannons
And you won‚Äôt be able to vsify different types of bearings
Because one vs bearing works like all the others
Lmao
Oh genius
Listen it may support 256 chunks by 256 chunks but that doesn‚Äôt mean *assembling* 256 X 256 chunks
:trol:
Well yeah it‚Äôs a vs ship
Vsified contraptions getting caught on things will also be used as a mechanic
When a vsifiied bearing gets caught, it will actually strain the kinetic system
Allowing you to make a physical manual break
If you want to
~~ewou‚Äôs figuring that one out rn~~
essentially it will slow or stop a section of the kinetic system, which can be cut off with like a clutch or gearbox or whatever
We‚Äôre planning a ‚ÄúThis is Clockwork‚Äù style video
üòâ
No spoilers
Oh also there will be a nondescript no spoiler event before clockwork‚Äôs release
That‚Äôs gonna be fun too
Yes
Terrain is in fact a block in the way
:clueless:
:trol:
DORIME
Well we say cope and move on
Idc about aero‚Äôs shenanigans
Nah
Cope gets the message across
Exactly
We say cope
We rile them up
Then they download clockwork to shit on it
And find out it‚Äôs good
We win
Gg
Why be petty when you can make a good mod for people to enjoy no matter the context?
:3dsus:
Pettiness is for cowards and people who can‚Äôt make a better mod
If you can make a good mod just do it
the oldie
It lives on in its new reincarnation
still does the pulse with double click
Just skips the windup
Boutta add a pulse weapon /j
actually I had an idea for the physics infuser that probably won‚Äôt be used but I may add a variant of it that does work like this:
I call it the ‚ÄúHeart of the ship‚Äù
Essentially
said heart infuser would be able to take multiple hits
But break
Essentially giving a way to make combat more strategic
Than
‚ÄúBlow up every last block‚Äù
Nah
But a living infuser could be cool
It wouldn‚Äôt work the same as the normal one
Would be incredible for servers like skybound
Living infuser needs to be sustained /j
Actually this is totally an r&d idea
Nvm
This fits in way more with r&d‚Äôs eldritch sculk stuff
R&D is all about eldritch stuff
I think it would fit there too
Eldritch vs mechs
What is this, borderlands Helios one?
Yeah it‚Äôd look like that
I really should work on the non mech features of r&d while I wait for mechs to be posssible
But I need to stay on the clockwork grind for now
Oh god the redstone engines
Nah eye works
Fits too because it‚Äôs the only sculk thing on your side and it‚Äôs the only sculk thing that can see
like you‚Äôve opened its eye
fuck it, laser beam
guardian laser mixed with sound laser?
Seems like a good idea for an enemy but the eye you‚Äôd want to defend
So idk if it should have offensive capabilities
I think it would be better for the opposite
True
R&D really is just crackhead clockwork isn‚Äôt it
The debug hinge is in the creative menu, you gotta search for it
Version?
Anyways
Latest off of cf doesn‚Äôt have
Get it from GitHub
Package
On the right
Under ‚Äúassets‚Äù it‚Äôs the last file
The one that just says .jar
I‚Äôm just imagining now r&d‚Äôs sculk shit going on about something and then the ship core squinting like
https://youtu.be/8yYvt6cVozw
>echoing from a giant vessel
what if the whole gimmick of the living ship is that like
It wants to be your friend
But it also doesn‚Äôt want to starve
Oh my god I can go full darwinist
Hold on
So what if there‚Äôs specific structures you need to build and link to the heart on a ship
Like say a massive stomach room
Build a body
I was gonna say it can probably just eat food-
You get exp from sculk after breaking it because it‚Äôs alive
ye obv
Nah I won‚Äôt do exp
There‚Äôs already something that uses exp that‚Äôs sculk
It‚Äôs the Sculk Mech
This eye doesn‚Äôt do that
I think just feeding it food makes more sense
And is also easier to sustain
:clueless:
Yeah but r&d isn‚Äôt meant to be a modpack setting kinda deal
Supposed to work on its own
It can work in a modpack obv but like
The balance of it will be thrown off
Exactly
I don‚Äôt wanna feed it glowy orbs
I wanna feed it the blood of my enemies
After I use it to blow them up
Exactly
Right click the infuser to give it a pat on the head like a dog
one thing tho
The r&d infuser would not disassemble
Once you wake it up
It‚Äôs on the move until it dies
Nah it‚Äôs rooted to the ship
It‚Äôd be like ripping up a tree
That shit ain‚Äôt live
Yeah but the original roots are fucked
And the original roots are your fuckin ship
The parasites mod reminded me of how I want it to be compatible with r&d so you can truly purge some eldritch shit
Sculk and Mechs: *fighting*
Sculk: **truce?**
Nah no good parasites
They are horrific
Naturally spawning ships üò≥
The evil Wheatley co-
Klarkson:‚Äùyou know, for some kinda hideous amalgamation of machine and flesh, you‚Äôre not so bad‚Äù

klarkson: ‚Äúi have no idea what you just said‚Äù
It is a neat concept to me
Ark technically has caring for mobile bases if you count shoving meat into its inventory
I don‚Äôt
Hmm
Translator pointless
Will just give it specific sounds for when hungry
Or pissed off
glglglblglglgl
LMAO
Ladders do work
0.5g finally getting fixed
I will say this- I‚Äôm going to personally work on a clockwork powered airship once the mod is in a playable state
And I don‚Äôt just mean like a simple airship
Nah I‚Äôm gonna go full out building
This thing is gonna push the limits of clockwork
Gets under your skin
Cause it‚Äôs a spike
Tends to be good at getting under skin
It doesn‚Äôt seem to signify danger
It more seems to signify importance
Lmfao
Holy shit
Got a good eye for perspective
I can appreciate that
:3dsus:
Suspicious
Grannit 8
Wrong vs2 version
Do you have curseforge version
I want to learn Japanese
The what
Uhh
You motherfucker
smiley is stop, notes
Oh my god it actually says sassu
Incredible explanation ewou
I mean g works now
But only play test
That should be public soon
Does latest GitHub have the uh
0.5G fix
I forgor
Oh aight
But tnt cannons no work
üòî
You know I wonder
That‚Äôs normal
It‚Äôs the same as ‚Äúthe server is running (number) ticks behind‚Äù
But for physics ticks
Also tends to happen
Random errors in the server console aren‚Äôt important
As long as it doesn‚Äôt say !!! PHYSICS ENGINE CRASHED !!!
You‚Äôre fine
Ye
:trol: so
lmfao
We may subtly and silently slide him
Ya know
üïô
Lmfao
Not the mod content just the patches for create stuff
Shalz is big in create community
We must show we are not broken as shit with create :clueless:
eh Shalz is probably not gonna be easy to get a hold of
??
On which video
Repost link I can‚Äôt search YouTube easily on this shitty mobile keyboard
lmfao
Clearly
Oh shit hey man
You want to be able to build trains and shit on airships?
:clueless:
well then
Smh
Yeah the full compat is still a wip HOWEVER
it‚Äôs pretty neat
Oh also Shalz you can make ships ‚Äúfall‚Äù by breaking the helm- the only reason it wouldn‚Äôt slide down that slope was because the helm stabilization forces it upright
Eureka forces ships to float like that
Ye
also check out the infuser
I couldn‚Äôt send you it cause it‚Äôs not done yet but

I spent all day on it
üò¢
One day for the animation
One day for the model
Cause I was lazy the first day
:clueless:
This will assemble any ship marked out with bluperglue (blue superglue very original)
Without stabilization
Essentially what I‚Äôm getting at @Shalz is would you like clockwork early :trol:
Beat you to it Ruby, :clueless:
LMAO
:trol:
üò≥
we gotta wrap up clockwork nicely to send it first but we can pass it to you soon :trol:
me when the chest
Why do you have a poorly cropped png of your face in the right corner pogging
Man‚Äôs bald
üíÄ
Lmfao fair
Bet
Red Bull gives you wings
I sincerely hope we haven‚Äôt amogus‚Äôd all clocks for people in this server into being c*ockwork
Damn
Rango your videos are like so hit or miss with views
Or rather your vs2 videos are 2k+ and everything else less so
I dunno why
Your content is based
But ig mc is mc
Yes
Stardust mechs won‚Äôt be the same as R&D mechs
They aren‚Äôt piloted
Stardust mechs are like soldiers
Ehe
Hehe
Tech said something about a megazord
The farter
The ultimate thruster clearly
Takeoff bearings spin freely
Farters can‚Äôt be disabled for now
Mostly cause clockwork took me away
Shader issue
Will happen with shaders on for some reason
Save that seed
Journeymap moment
Or off of GitHub Packages
If you want latest beta
What?
It was never made for aero
What is that man on
No like originally it was a geckolib mod?
And then I was gonna write my engine
and then I was like ‚Äúno wait, vs2‚Äù
Send it
Link

Because Ryan started talking about a landlord mech mod the moment I mentioned r&d was powered by vs2
No it‚Äôs abc
Always blame copper
jk
We aren‚Äôt talking bad about aero
But people keep confusing our projects as aero addons
Ye that isn‚Äôt the topic
Also landlord isn‚Äôt a physics engine it‚Äôs the shipyard handler
from my knowledge
The engine is simulated
they have like 4 different mods to do one thing :Thonk:
Fulfilled our daily quota
Cave Johnson, We‚Äôre done here
We don‚Äôt really care about the aero drama at this point**
However
It seems to be a common topic
On both servers
Every time I tab onto aero I see vs2
lmfao
Smh
No tpk that would be disastrous
Do not let him in
you‚Äôd give Ryan a conniption
If tpk had his way create and vs2 would both be locked to 1.12
They turned us down
bonked in fact
Smh
I mean 1.12 modded runs better than 1.19
Significantly
I want it because r&d is supposed to be 1.19
Since it has features based around the sculk
And I don‚Äôt wanna backport
Trol
I should work on that :clueless:
But like I have other work to do
Clockwork mostly
I‚Äôd be willing to port it, I can do that
But yeah I‚Äôll wait for ventities
Wait a second it‚Äôs this mf
My guy that‚Äôs me
R&D is Research and Development
R&D runs on vs2
So unless the two miraculously resolve their differences and join forces like shonen anime characters
It will not work with aero
Someone mentioned vs2 on aero yesterday and someone asked ‚Äúsomeone made visual studio 2? Ah shit‚Äù
VSbodies
Physics objects
The mechs are made out of a bunch of physics objects
Vscore isn‚Äôt even a mod technically it‚Äôs just a library(?)
I plan to build mekapi and by extension r&d off of vs2 because building off vscore would mean I have to rewrite all of the Minecraft sided things
And I don‚Äôt want to
We really need to clear up the eureka confusion
FISH ERROR SHALL NOT PREVIAL
WE SHALL

fuck it, vs2 intro song
welcome to hell
damn hell has more layers than shitty horror game lores
its too easy.
#takeoff
i STILL need to setup packages
***THAT'S NINE***
but uh
yeah
hold on haz built it recently
@Haz
would you be so kind as to provide us with that build of takeoff
with wings
:POGGERS:
it has a forge
but
idk if rango has the build of it
hold on lemme load up the project rq
1 forge build comin right up
jesse
we need to cook
java
no fuckin way
daniel the diamond minecartaniel
insert rhythmic drumming sound effect while i wait for it to build
i like how packages would be so very easy to set up
but like
i just dont

behold
frog
yes
its pinned
in the docs
in the chanmble
ohhh
grab the github vers
will work
no
no compiling
packages work on vs2
just downlaob
here 1 sec ill send it

actually we're up to beta 9
üò≥
seems like curseforge is in need of a new update
it wasnt just fish
it was collision with any entity
yeah
as it turns out
the ladder mixin did *not* work
triode had to fix it
yes
feexed
on latest github
i made a pr of triode's fix
ye
we need to update cf
damn
they will provide thrust whenever placed on a ship
they have no way to toggle rn
but
for kickstarting stuff they are useful
also wings in takeoff work as you think
thrust forward = lift up
they spin freely
probably :clueless:
there are no helms in takeoff
helms are a eureka thing\
uhh
it depends on how triode and dust coded it
also the fact that eureka will resist the lift it applies
but
it would probably
guh
did mixin get do undone
mixin got fucked
Ported bloodmagic caught up
Thermal dynamics still no port, been like 5 years has no excuse kekw
I forgor actually
Thermal is not the same anymore
With clockwork yes but that‚Äôs closed for now
However shalz may be getting it sneakily handed under the table
Worse
Without dynamics thermal is not the same mod
The only part about thermal I even liked
Was dynamics
The fluxducts and itemducts
Unfortunately he won‚Äôt be getting the propellors or infuser because they ain‚Äôt done
If @Triode adds wings to vs2 main sail wings would be piss easy
Yeah but now it has zero nuance
It is basic bitch tech mod
It‚Äôs even worse than mekanism imo cause it has zero personality
At least mekanism while overpoweeed and broken has a vibe
Thermal is so nothing
Nah rftools is fully caught up now
Only based rf tech mod remaining imo
All the others fell off
Exists I just don‚Äôt use it
I mainly care about the new stuff in rf tools
It has a lot more now
Idk man go read the list of the 7 addons
It‚Äôs a massive mod collection
It lives up to its name
It‚Äôs basically all the tools you need
Imo best underrated tech mod by far is cyclic
It‚Äôs always the mod that‚Äôs in a pack, carries it from the underneath, and never gets noticed
I swear every single time I have that mod in a pack and I use one of its blocks I go
Exactly
Bet
When i get home tomorrow I‚Äôll finish up the infuser, wings, and give the propellor actual thrust
Then it‚Äôll be set to actually do something
entities do technically inherit velocity
Kinda
Projectiles definitely do
players it‚Äôs a bit iffy
idk how that happened
nah
Farters have existed for like a month
Gamers I have a three day weekend approaching
There will be coffee
There will not be much sleep
And there will be PROGRESS
Not a priority until we add better water occlusion
Yes
Valkyiren computers
It‚Äôll probably be krunchitized
Also as for land
You see
#mekapi
No mechs (yet)

Yes
But private
vc is already doing it
+servos
Oh god
You gave me vw war flashbacks
as in they‚Äôre burning in a trash heap
I will make you a model for them based on the og model
Like clockwork‚Äôs infuser
No I mean inspired by og model
For le reference
So someone can make a logibrain with vs2
I mean with clockwork
Redstone contacts will work from ship to ground
And between ships
I think that‚Äôs essentially the kick off point for complex redstone ships
Redstone contacts with create will allow ships to communicate with redstone on the ground via well, contact
Imagine the shit you could pull off with that
Too much
Hola
Casual unconstrained physics objects :3dsus:
Also saves
Debug hinge doesn‚Äôt save
However the takeoff hinge has other issues lmao
It‚Äôs very bendy
Yes
Under even a decent force it unaligns
Nah i think it‚Äôs an engine quirk
Triode was working on rigider constraints
but not done
the current constraints are made of rubber bands
According to triode the current constraint solver is very simple but not very solid
Ye, and better than just applying forces
so they‚Äôll actually work as you‚Äôd expect
new lod gonna be great
But vsbodies gonna be even better
I genuinely don‚Äôt know why it broke
Fix one thing a new leak springs
Me want make mech and car and tank
Then help me with armor pen
Flans mod ain‚Äôt gonna have shit on what we‚Äôre gonna do
I almost made a joke but I think it‚Äôd get ender assassinated so I can‚Äôt
LMAO
Yes
Was gonna say something about a certain square but replace square with cube
It mostly does but obv most things aren‚Äôt designed around scale
It‚Äôs a wip
Hence why there is zero way to do it survival
Well we‚Äôre all doomed

The R&D ai just went sentient
:guh:
A logo rework wouldn‚Äôt be entirely a bad idea
We should have a competition for who can make the best vs2 logo rework :clueless:
I mean eureka‚Äôs logo in comparison to vs2‚Äôs
Ye
The V and the helm
And not just ‚Äúyellow to black gradient clipping mask‚Äù
And a traced ship helm
I could try
I didn‚Äôt really notice before but looking at the line work

very sussy library
Eh
What
Autocorrect
Library
Line art
Smh
Very sus line art
The totally not traced off Getty images wheel
No I‚Äôm saying it looks traced lmao
Incredible
Maybe I‚Äôll doodle one in class :clueless:
I think it was ankiolyne
I do like how the helm isn‚Äôt just dead on
If I make a vs2 logo idea it won‚Äôt be so flat
Did you make that or is it from somewhere
Ah
An ai generated logo :3dsus:
Oh god wait it‚Äôs fake pixel art
It‚Äôs not grid aligned
I mean that ai logo is neat and a good reference idea
But like
It‚Äôs definitely not representative of the mod at all
Lol
>Valkyrien skies
Jei is your friend
Or whatever the fabric equivalent is
Well technically you don‚Äôt need eureka
But like
It‚Äôs the main one released rn
Could asko use takeoff
I do need to add one lol
smh
Clockwork one uses bluperglue
Has no assembly logic
doesn‚Äôt need it since glue is an aabb
Just grab all blocks and contraptions in the bluperglue‚Äôs aabbs
That‚Äôs how you do most things in create
But bluperglue has a higher max size
Than superglue
Same with how eureka is a test bench for what a usable addon is without being very
They both serve similar purposes
Takeoff will be an actual addon eventually
But for now it‚Äôs a feature test bench
Takeoff with PB and LasagnaLib will be fun
Physics tech mod trollage
Nah bro it wasn‚Äôt just fish
It infected every entity collision
we had to rapid patch that
Apparently it was the ladder mixin
It was force setting position without checking if that was okay
Triode fixed it with two imports and five lines
So true
Essentially
It was messing with entity collision to let you climb the ladder
But it also messed with
All entity collision
I have no idea
It mutated
I think it did happen with other entities
Just nobody tested player pushing an entity
Smh
Literally fernai‚Äôs fault
Fern is not murican
Fern is Russian
Yeah I am
Damn really
Takeoff should work fine
Wait it‚Äôs actual compat compat
Not just no crashing?
Ohh
Explains things cause I‚Äôve absolutely neglected Forge on takeoff
:clueless:
I wonder if I could edit mods.toml on my phone somehow
I could just fix it
Hola
:guh:
the answer is yes
ships are not bound by worldheight either way
man
wings are fun as hell
#takeoff
wrong branch
feature/wings/

they "work"
but since you cant control speed
they just constantly get faster and get unstable
because wing solver cant handle hyperspeed rn
since we arent aero with the 5 mile per hour planes
and actually get fast enough to be unstable
:clueless:
whats really cool is that your view actually rotates
so it doesnt get disorienting
debug seat
https://youtu.be/ppXS6sUZPTA
wait
hasnt processed
my voice didnt record in the video
:(
but yeah i use eureka ballasts to control pitch and yaw
unfortunately its very scuffed
and wing solver breaks down emotionally
at high speed
ye but they dont work
do they
the shitmobile is dead üòü
speaking of c*ockwork
rango
remember how you said jokingly "im a youtuber where's my early clockwork"
well :trol:
triode suggested adding you to the early access club
though youd have to wait a few days
~~will have wings, propellors, and the infuser~~
we were originally gonna give shalz the compat mixins but i thought like
so im gonna include some content with it
been on the grindset
genuinely
i didnt make these wings so im experiencing them for the first time rn
this is shitloads of fun
NOOOO
THE SHITMOBILE REALLY IS DEAD
:diesofdeath:

I GOT SHIPYARDED
NOOOO
you see i went at
mach 12
and the wing solver
really hated that
dust is adding a helm to takeoff that just applies torque impulse and has no stabilization
so planes are easier to control
I wouldn‚Äôt claim anything
It could be earlier or later than any guesses we make
Depends on if we keep adding new ideas or stick to what we‚Äôve got planned so far
Implying it won‚Äôt be till march is a bold decision
:clueless:
Skull emoji
Genius
Triode I made a shitmobile
MekAPI
MekAPI is gonna be handling physics body vehicles
That‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in forever wtf
Mekapi draws closer every day
VSBodies and new lod
Mekapi is gonna have for example
It‚Äôs gonna be model-based physics vehicles and also a tool for other mods to add them
Up to you to decide how you wanna build roads and stuff for them
yes
It‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna power r&d mechs as well
Mekapi would be cool to see in other developers places
But crayfish‚Äôs vehicle system is very robust
I would know as I‚Äôve ported cvm before and tried to use a similar system for r&d mechs originally
yeah I know for the custom vehicles but I mean a total rewrite
Like mekapi does not even use mc entities
Except for seats but
Can‚Äôt get around that unfortunately
Because doing a backflip on a motorbike is cool
:clueless:
Also
There isn‚Äôt a shitload practical about a giant 7 block tall (22ft tall) mech with simulated limbs and enough mass to knock an airship out the air
But like
Does it need to be practical
Well that‚Äôs not really a minigun
That‚Äôs just a fast loading cannon
I‚Äôm gonna be adding a nerf rhino style potato turret as a real minigun :clueless:

This thing but potato
Collision damage is planned
But I think it‚Äôs waiting on the same thing that ship splitting is
that being a clean and efficient method of checking ship connections that isnt floodfill
Because floodfill is
Slow
Especially when you spam it
Who gives a shit lmao
oh no we aren‚Äôt on topic in general what will we do
Guess we gotta call the discord mod
LMFAO
I really want to work on code right now but I‚Äôm stuck in class :(
I could be fixing propellors as we speak
But instead I am trapped here
They will once clockwork is ready
Nah bro I gotta get on the grindset
Me and triode are gonna obliterate this weekend

Funny create + vs
Fun fact I did a little oopsie
So bluperglue, our glue for assembly, didn‚Äôt work for a long ass time right
But get this
It was because I never registered the handler üíÄ
‚ÄúI wonder why my code doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù
>code not being run
One of them is wrong
The start is windup
But it says zap
I gotta fix it lmao
The physics infuser
It does exactly what it‚Äôs name says
Nah I just disabled it‚Äôs assembly since I was working on making glue work
It was supposed to skip
I clowned a little
I‚Äôm using a create LerpedFloat for the counter variable
But it won‚Äôt let me force set its progress
So
Hence why you can skip if you want
But you don‚Äôt need to if you want the drama
It‚Äôll still send the pulse out though either way
Cause all it does is
It sets the animation progress to 400
so like fast forwarding
A tad sus
Also no campfires do work on ships
I saw someone building with them
The other day
It also grabs contraptions and superglue and drags them with it
Or any shipyard entity for that matter
I gotta work on that though
Essentially to avoid the problem of ‚ÄúI want to assemble/disassemble time to go and disable every single contraption on my ship‚Äù
Because that‚Äôs lame
:3drevenge:
I will
Once I‚Äôm home
I would recommend waiting on wings

Triode changed them
Essentially rn all things in takeoff use gametick position calc
So they fuck up bad at high speed
He fixed it by adding it to vs core but it‚Äôs not in main yet
Ballasts
Essentially
Ballasts on means more weight forcing down that side
No
It‚Äôs in vs core
Wing solver is being moved there and a new function is as well
For calculating position on phystick
Instead of
Gametick
Ye
Clockwork takeoff and dust‚Äôs addon will all use the same wing solver
That way you can combine the wings with little issue
I‚Äôm not sure specifically
Also, wings will work on contraptions if you couldn‚Äôt gather from the flap bearing idea
Only thing is that
Unfortunately
Well, ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùunfortunately‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
We have to ditch the aero precedent that sails work as wings
Because otherwise windmills would have unlimited thrust
Lmfao
And propellors would accidentally work double time
So we will have a dedicated wing block
But not much lost to be honest
Probably almost identical to sails
Just with a different frame
Nah aero did that already
:3drevenge:
They made a tiered sail that is literally just objectively better than sails
For some reason
It‚Äôs 2x as efficient
Millenaire + create would be
Insane
Actually
I‚Äôm not much of a porter tbh but I could always look into it someday
I have too much on my plate though
Way too much
I have seven different projects already
I‚Äôm working on every addon except islands and valk computers
Please send help
yes and also clockwork
Lead dev and lead art director for both
And also the lead Dev and lead art director of rnd
Will be lead Dev of mekapi obv
Also potato battery
Can‚Äôt forget that one
And I wanted to help with the vs2 1.19 port
So like
probably idk
It‚Äôs not a hard port
Technically but sussy
The propellor bearing is more reliable
Well that‚Äôs the option
You either have a vsified contraption with wings
Or a propellor bearing
There is no vsified prop bearing because it‚Äôs unnecessary
This has reminded me
I need to work on a gyroscope
There‚Äôs gonna be a multiblock gyro
It only works when it‚Äôs massive
It‚Äôs for huge ships not small ones
Because small ships don‚Äôt need a gyro
They‚Äôre relatively easy to balance
But massive ships
They need to stabilize
I‚Äôm impressed rope pulleys even work on vs ships
I thought we fixed them in clockwork
Oh well
Plane?
No
I guess they do work
But we made them ground collide (somewhat) so
Lmao
Nah I think it‚Äôs the position code being funky again
Triode is getting some well earned sleep and then he has to wagie so maybe I will take up the mantle and finish wings
Spinning Contraptions won‚Äôt ever collide with ground because that would break a lot of mechanisms that rely on bearing clipping
Not including drill actors obv
But static moving contraptions will
Like rope pulleys and whatnot
Reasoning being that we won‚Äôt have a vsified rope pulley in the typical sense
The rope will be as well
It does it just doesn‚Äôt render
It will place and it will stick
It will not show up
Visual thing
You have vsified contraptions for that
:3dsus:
World isn‚Äôt fucked
Trust me
It‚Äôs part of a takeoff saving issue
That world will be fixed when I patch it later today
Essentially wings aren‚Äôt saving their existence properly
So the game sees them as null
And has a hissy fit
It‚Äôs because of a non null assertion that I didn‚Äôt add
:clueless:
Happened to farters and balloons for a while
Doesn‚Äôt now
Listen I had to drop it for clockwork
I got dm‚Äôd like a black market deal to join the team
And now am it‚Äôs director somehow
I want a funky contributor role but for that I actually have to contribute
lmfao
And I suppose that means contributing to vs main
Which I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd do
My random PRs with some json fixes don‚Äôt count LOL
it‚Äôs alright I‚Äôll simply be the addon dev of the ages :clueless:
By working on every Addon
At once
Trol
I will give us content to use this engine for
Thank you for that kind sir
I made the infuser model in about an hour
Propellor bearing was a speedrun
15 minutes
Not very amazing because of that
Needs a rework
Also the bluperglue tube is literally a recolor of the superglue item right now LMAO
I need to give it a unique thing but I have so little space to work with
I could make it
A model
Because 1. Mixin hell
And 2
Consider this scenario
You have a lot of machines on your airship
You
To assemble it
You have now glued all of your machines
To your airship
The moment you turn them on
:guh:
Bluperglue works like this
It is like a third party
It operates above the other two but one way interacts
So that you can‚Äôt glue your ship to your turret
But your turret stays glued to your ship
It also has another benefit
It doesn‚Äôt have the range limit of glue
Rather it has a much higher one
So assembling large ships is far less of a pain
it does
It also can‚Äôt connect things that aren‚Äôt technically connected but I disabled that check for bluperglue
So you can have diagonals
Oh also small note
It works in reverse
When you disassemble
So if you build a new contraption on your ship while it‚Äôs assembled and don‚Äôt want to lose it
Bluperglue it
And then when you disassemble itll get pulled
Now this may cause issues if someone acts stupid and doesn‚Äôt glue their contraptions but that‚Äôs on them
I may do some auto detection stuff but that could have a chance of accidentally pulling tangentially related contraptions that aren‚Äôt actually attached so
Wdym?
bluperglue doesn‚Äôt care
It takes glue and contraptions with it
And isn‚Äôt effected by glue at all
Unless you‚Äôre talking about a create logistical issue in which case that isn‚Äôt really my problem lmao
large contraption that has a lot of blocks connected to the ship though?
Wouldn‚Äôt you just use normal glue for the contraption and then bluperglue over that normal glue
I don‚Äôt see the issue
Eh?
Do you know how 1.18 create glue works
it‚Äôs a selection box
Lmao
Since seven months ago
Bruh
Did you think I was forcing people to build a ship
One by one
I‚Äôm not a psychopath
That‚Äôs what I meant by glue range limit
Lol
Bluperglue‚Äôs selection box has a much higher range limit
Significantly higher
LMFAO WAIT DID YOU OFFHAND IT
BRO NO SHOT
I refuse to believe you did that
üíÄ
Actually you can offhand bluperglue too
If you‚Äôre
Masochistic
Because have you never right clicked with 1.18 glue???
It literally says ‚Äúfirst position set‚Äù my guy
And then starts creating a bounding box to your cursor
Tells you if it‚Äôs not connected or out of range
And this is why we offered the build to shalz first /j
LMFAO
smh my head
More like clock don‚Äôt work
No don‚Äôt use this as 1.12 propaganda
Oh that
I was instinctively preparing to throw that out when you said it‚Äôs ok
Muscle memory
it‚Äôs just an okay version
So
Nah idgaf about any of the other mods including yours /j
Can someone explain to me why no transfer mod has ever matched thermal
Like
Please
Why is dynamics still the best
And why is it still not ported
Create‚Äôs blockstate pipes suck ass
Thermal dynamics is part of the thermal series
It‚Äôs the best resource transfer mod
To ever exist
It has not been matched in like
Years
But it hasn‚Äôt been updated because it‚Äôs creator got hired by mojang
it‚Äôs okay lasagna lib will be better trol
Whenever we get around to that
Funny mini block pipes
My favorite part of thermal was that the pipes actually held the fucking liquid or item and didn‚Äôt just do an animation or scuffed blockstate thing
Me
Cause I did it in five seconds
It is backwards
Oh you mean the model?
That‚Äôs create sails
they‚Äôre one sided :3drevenge:
Ye it‚Äôs like 4 cubes lol
Nah it‚Äôs got more than a flat rectangle
They have a stilt and the sail is pushed forwards
They‚Äôre shaped kinda like a table
But with really stubby legs
You can kinda see here

Yeah that‚Äôs the frame
I just want to be home already man
I have so much to work on
üòµ‚Äçüí´
It looks neat
It‚Äôs only 10
I‚Äôve got another few hours
:E_sleepdeprived:
It just is
Specifically uh
Clockwork wings will look more like wings than sails
They‚Äôll also use connected textures
So they won‚Äôt look so off when tiled
Create has a connected texture and model system
I‚Äôm gonna be using it for this
wings will probably have a frame on the bottom and the wing surface at the top in clockwork
For wings on their side
They‚Äôll have the frame on the side connected to the ground
Instead of looking weird from one angle
Cause I dislike that about create sails
Essentially think of a tail fin
The one facing up will have one side be the frame
And the other wool
I dislike that
When you don‚Äôt have a shader or when you do
weirdchamp
It should be the other way around
I‚Äôm not sure flywheel shader compat works in vs2 yet
But that‚Äôs sussy
Oh yeah try to disable flywheel optimizations
/flywheel something
Oh speaking of commands
For creative builders I implemented the glue command from create into clockwork
So
/clockwork bluper (pos1) (pos2)
Will create bluperglue from one position to another
I‚Äôm never letting you live the manual glue down tho
Slightly worse performance
Since flywheel makes optimizations
But they fuck with rendering so disabling them makes stuff render easier
Lmfao
It only happens with iris
It‚Äôs because of iris flywheel compat being sus as hell
Ye but that mod no work
Essentially think about it like this
Vs iris and flywheel are all mixing into the same shit
The mod ‚Äúiris-flywheel compat‚Äù borks vs2
Iris and vs2 Bork create
And I think there‚Äôs a way to get create and vs2 to Bork iris
It‚Äôs literally a three way death
Yes it does
But it‚Äôs three different rendering engines
So we really need compat from all sides
Iris aint performance
Iris is shaders
Heavily modded 1.18 forge performs better than sky factory for me smh
No betterfps
Ye
You do
Betterfps 1.12 was a requirement for me iirc
Optifine :3drevenge:
I hate optifine
Correction
Optifine does not handle very well
TPK I have a question for you
If you‚Äôre so dead set on porting new stuff back
Why don‚Äôt you make something to port the old performance forwards
Fix the modern jank a little
Undo some of the dogshit decisions
Mojank may be bad but mixins stand tall
You may break everything along the way but a perfect world is one with 1.12 performance on 1.18
No one can
Nah that‚Äôs 1.19
1.18 worldgen is fine
Okay no 1.15 was genuine improvement
1.15 performance is still unmatched with tnt
Unironically
They did something right that time
Too bad no one remembers the version
Honestly 1.15 was a serious underdog update
Completely changed redstone forever
And added crazy performance
For tnt
Which previously was dogshit
And a few other things
We really need a new 1.15
Btw they didn‚Äôt go cubic chunks because
That would break a lot
Pretty much require a rewrite of mc‚Äôs entire loading system
There‚Äôs a difference between breaking a lot and breaking everything
1.17 was a travesty
Idk why they bothered to even publish 1.17
It added nothing of substance
well yeah no shit it had no chunk size changing
1.17 was literally just blocks
No that was 1.18
1.17 removed the height changing
It was literally just blocks
No it doesn‚Äôt
It was entirely just useless deco blocks
1.17 snapshots removed height changing after the split was announced
Then 1.18 added it back
It was 1.15 without the reasons we like 1.15
No performance no fixes no anything
Just
Items
Counter argument
Honey blocks
Honeyblocks had meaningful content
One meaningful content
A single
But it was an insanely meaningful one
For redstone
Infinitely scalable piston machines
Because of honey blocks
Fair but for redstone enthusiasts it‚Äôs the biggest game changer since fuckin hopper minecarts
They still do it just has no fanfare
It‚Äôs become like slime blocks
Used everywhere without even thinking about it
So 1.15 had something of meaning and it fixed a lot
1.17 was a nothing update
It was like a ‚Äúbaby‚Äôs first mc mod‚Äù
Don‚Äôt diss 16 it‚Äôs still the best modern update
Vertical biomes :clueless:
Better nether combined with 1.16 nether tho is doubly as good
Plus it added fire resistant wood
I return
What did I miss
Correct
Is it weird I actually kinda like it LMFAO
it‚Äôs so shit
Also I like how you can tell it‚Äôs just a shitty png over the case
Because it doesn‚Äôt perspective right
Jesus h christ
It‚Äôs so round
I forgot that everything was round in 2006
Also holy fuck my brain is ruined
I almost wrote 1.6
Instead of 2006
LMFAO
Real life 1.6
It looks like a Mercedes benz front
Also why the fuck does it have a mini USB port on the front case
Wait no
Is that display port mini
What even is that
Is that some archaic format I don‚Äôt remember
It‚Äôs not dvi

Genuinely what port is that
It looks like an arrow
Bro
I had the fuckin cube
Aint no way
Literally the definition of ‚Äúgamer pc‚Äù
Aint no way bro

The fuckin cube
I don‚Äôt remember if this is the one
But it‚Äôs a literal cube
It was also a total scam
Get this
It was SLOWER THAN A HARD DRIVE
how does one even manage to make a ssd slower than a hdd
Because someone fucked around and found out
Most sane vs2 conversation
Evolutionarily we had to figure that out
Yes
No we only recognize the smell as bad because of evolution
Alright that‚Äôs a check off the daily quota
Insane ramblings
We gotta uhh
So
Here I‚Äôll handle the first one
aero :3drevenge:
Done
Onto the next
Fabric better in 1.19 because vanilla performance can no longer be relied on to be usable
On your system
For me it doesn‚Äôt make a difference because I have plenty of resources for forge to hog
BRO IT HAD APPLE PROPEIETARY?
What the fuck
FireWire is great to be fair
Best proprietary cable
But
It‚Äôs still proprietary
At least it wasn‚Äôt a 30 pin lol
FireWire can give just the slightest bit more power than a lot of other cable types
It can revive old devices that use it far better than the other cables they support
You‚Äôre right
What‚Äôs the next discussion
We gotta get through the checklist before 11
Already happened once today
We‚Äôre good
Except motivation
Addon api?
What about vsbodies
üíÄ
The shalz effect
True but
We can do it
The power of mekapi will not be halted
Port to use mekapi
Trol
Wait even better
Join mekapi team
VSBodies
I thought VSolids works better but Ruby said soft bodies
Even though soft bodies are still solids
Ah
Rip
Oh well
I intend to do anything immersive vehicles can with mekapi
Krunch physics let you do a flip on a bike and actually rotate properly with it
Don‚Äôt need to say more
That‚Äôs it
bruhhh
LMAO
Awful
Good news for mekapi
so we don‚Äôt need to do stall logic
Wings already should handle it
Another check off the list
Wait I know
We haven‚Äôt said cockwork yet
There
It was inevitable that mekapi would lead into a gran turismo rant
Holy shit my everything hurts
I just had to speed run
An entire 2 unit test for history
In 30 minutes
It was 9 pages
And I had to do it with my hand
So my hand is on fire
From using a shitty blue ballpoint pen
At Mach 12
Same
I permanently dented my finger
Isall good
It‚Äôs not entirely from clas
I write very hard
Press down too much
It‚Äôs from drawing too üòì
I can‚Äôt
I‚Äôm a digital artist
my drawing tablet is my prized possession but damn does it‚Äôs pen suck dick
it‚Äôs a kamvas 22
Big ass screen drawing tablet
Yeah none of that Wacom btw
They cost too much
That was for a test Ruby
I‚Äôm in school rn
bro Itll get stolen
No cap
I want a fountain pen
Fone
No
I‚Äôm traumatized from mechanical pencils
I use them and they are the reason my hand dent
Too much pressure to write
Tpk would be the guy to say ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre having a heart attack? Just get up‚Äù
LMFAO
I am not in ap history
I‚Äôm in ap Lang and ap computer science
it‚Äôs essentially honors squared
I‚Äôm not that good of a student lmao
Tbh
I care more about vs2 than I do half my classes because they‚Äôre all rehash of shit I learned in 7th grade
Especially English like bro
It‚Äôs just writing
I‚Äôm in ap because all I have to do is hand stuff in on time to get hundreds
I speak two languages and English is the only one I really remember since it‚Äôs been years since I spoke Italian competently
So I do not have issues with English
It is
The American education system barely works but it does teach you a lot of shit you don‚Äôt need to know
I don‚Äôt remember anything I learn beyond tests anyways so whatever
I feel like a good base education ends in junior year
What am I even doing here
I don‚Äôt lmao
My school doesn‚Äôt teach me that
I‚Äôve genuinely learned more maths devving this mod
Then I have
In precalc
Chem is worthless here
Physics reteaches it but better
MOLES
Me when my 6.02*10^23 slices of cheese
I wish
Bro it‚Äôs not hard
Already know them :3drevenge:
I really should not say the joke I just typed
That would put me on a list
I was about to say I can make a chemical weapon but I think if I say that I‚Äôll be taken into custody
I have to clarify
That is a joke
My FBI agent watching me when I give the most detailed plan for enacting a federal crime possible and then seeing I put ‚Äúin Minecraft‚Äù at the end
He was just quirked up
He‚Äôd still be alive if you gamers aint gas him up
Ye
I mean uh noooo we‚Äôll kill you on the spot
for daring to
Be a person and need assistance
/j
But yeah go ahead
Ye
Gone
Just ask it if you need assistance
We‚Äôre all here lol
Fabric or forge?
Other mods?
Do you have iris
Version of vs2
Is it curseforge latest
Ye happens when create gets borked
Yes it is
Create compat is for 1.18
It‚Äôs too hard to support both versions of create as they are majorly different mods
Connection terminated.
I‚Äôm sorry Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name- but I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve been misinformed.
You are not here to receive a gift- nor have you been called here by the individual who you assume, though you have indeed been called.
A labyrinth with no exit- a maze with no prize.
We do gotta fix that do
I‚Äôll make a pr once home
Just die and you‚Äôll respawn stir
Wdym it didn‚Äôt work
Where do you respawn
ü§®
How do you manage
Genuinely
Well here‚Äôs an idea
Have you exited the world, if not don‚Äôt
Alt f4 and exit without saving
I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to what you did to it
Bro go the fuck to sleep
Or no clockwork
You don‚Äôt
well you can if you enable it in config
But
It‚Äôs kinda sus
I would not recommend doing it unless you need to
Eureka config
Go into main menu
Click on mods
Scroll down
Click on eureka
Click config
You have to have cloth as it‚Äôs a dependency but the auto downloader probably grabbed it
No need
It‚Äôs fixed
Just upgrade your vs2
Latest GitHub package
Or latest modrinth
I don‚Äôt think cf approved it yet
Which vers
Beta 10?
Click files
Oh wait it‚Äôs beta 9
Isn‚Äôt beta 9 the fish bug version
@Rubydesic
Ah
Did that get pulled
Either way use beta 9 as that should have the create mixin fixes
No
At least I don‚Äôt think so
Create mixin fixes should be in beta 9
They gave me a mini heart attack
I think it‚Äôs Alex‚Äôs mobs
Fucking horrific
No
Not on beta 9
Trains are still locked to cockwork iirc
But 0.5G works now
One last class and then
I‚Äôm home
The grindset will begin
For real
sussy
No but progress will probably get more visible soon
When it hits twelve mod done
That‚Äôs what it means lol
You would be surprised at how much progress we‚Äôve made
Significant steps
Compat is a big chunk of clockwork and it is being completed at scary rates
It‚Äôs at 3:30
They look fine on mobile to me
Yes it is
Hour hand on 3 minute hand on 30
Oh wait
No you‚Äôre right
But that would be confusing
Cause there‚Äôs not much space
I AM HOME
someone in shalz's discord is remaking the eureka helms with creatified models and textures and
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844181724287729686/1063547736403755068/helms.png
damn
ye
this is just prettier textures/models
oh damn hey dude
i didnt realize LMFAO
yeah thats fair
the creatified ones look real good

gets a salute from moi
R&D
im actually going insane
rn
:haha:
i just spent like 20 minutes writing out a stupid blockstate file
this is what i get for wanting interconnectability
you dont understand it has
64
states
64
64
technically more
since it has another axis that doesnt have a unique model
the blockstate file is
164 lines long
:haha:
yes because ewou couldnt get hinges to work
:trol:
the create fluid tank is worse
but
it uses datagen
so the creators dont go insane
too late
i already did it all manually
trol
i dont even know if i got the axis right
and i havent added the
blockstate definitions required for it in code yet
i just did the json
mekapi
ye its a work in progress
also create mod content
but we're fixing stuff as we add content
kinda as we go
the fixes will be in main
when clockwork is done
but they're being developed as part of clockwork so we keep things centralized
on that note we (fluffy) actually found a bug in create the other day because of that
so
:clueless:
cause its not attached
its just a eureka ship bitchslapped onto the raft
LMAO
it doesnt aim for the ejector actually
what it does is
the ship is able to intercept the ejector path
which is still important compat because
the ejector doesnt actually throw the items
it calculates an arc
and now the ship is able to block that arc
could be very cool for like a
fly by unloading /loading of items
cant do that
ah
then yeah that works
you see the item isnt actually in midair
the item never leaves the ejector until the animation is done
the flying ejector item is just a model
its part of the ejector's block model
known issue on forge
ye if it is blocked it will land where it is b locked
we fixed it already in clockwork
fixed a lot of things actually
a lot of major create features work as youd expect or better than youd expect now
only 2 weeks and crazy progress already
the clock channel has some updates
we're at 3:30 on the clock, which is over a quarter way there
sus?
did you accidentally activate cruise
ahh
yes
the clock ticks towards 12
when it strikes twelve
we're done
the final quarter will probably be the longest
well cause the "final quarter" will be 90% bugfixing and intensive testing
and
that takes forever
and we will still miss some
because like
and the moment you release it to public
90 issues
go ahead
lmfao
no
yes
its impossible to catch in playtesting
too sanitized
yes
correct
there will be exclusively two people ~~for now~~ who will get access to clockwork before 12
and that is rango and shalz
1.12 vs does infact suck
we don't talk about vs1
yeah because we offered it and he said "yes"
true
but comparatively
it sucks
:clueless:
then we wouldnt have vs2
:trol:
shalz still didn't install latest vs2 like a doof
so cannons didnt work on his game
they do work
as you can see in the clock channel
id wait till you get access
to the funny
all of us lmao
he's in the clockwork early access channel
like a gold in the center and fences
i forgot
its a little sus
no
:clueless:
you're the last person id give access to
you wouldnt even find issues
youd just
materialize new ones
youd break something that works
in all seriousness
only reason rango has it is because triode said why not
probably the third person to get it if we add another will be haz
and then no more
until like at least 7:30 on the clock
we're a physics mod not the Physics Mod
üíÄ
if you want to support triode on patreon you can
in the name of krunch he deserves some help
:clueless:
actually the creator made compat with vs2 recently
which was kinda based
nah he always said he would
just finally got around to it
nah
well it does work with this actually
but its not real waves
its a visual effect
it is
the moving of players is visual
only as a config option, and thats still not actually simulating the waves
vs2 physics sim will not be exactly like physics mod
will probably not be anything like actually
it's for ship flooding and aerodynamic forces
for flooding i think a really low res way works but
for aerodynamics
true
cube
uhh
problem:
create
create does a lot of placing and removing blocks as it assembles and disassembles stuff
maybe we can remember a shadow of the create contraption's original position or something
true
functional collision physics be like
https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/yr2xu0/working_car_in_minecraft/ reminder that this was done with unconstrained ships inside another ship for the wheels and is still stable and not buggy despite constant collision
vs2 collision is hella stable
its krunch
triode's life work
best voxelshape physics engine out there
boutta get even better with new lod
vsbodies/v-entities are already in krunch, just waiting on mc implementation
to give you the rundown, aero zoinked code
and then
got salty when called out
ye but ruby working on the mc end
nah they were the zoinkers
they did a little
ctrl c
oh yeah disassembly is a little fucked
hence why its disabled by default lol
clockwork is gonna have better disassembly
but i gotta rework how it works
because eureka disassembly is
not good
even when alignjed
i still want to know
but ~~triode~~ diode like
ahh
so krunch but shit
ye because there are two other engines
bullet, which isnt good enough
and that other one which is good but a little sussy
i forgot its name
either way krunch best
I‚Äôm committing cannibalism rn
Porkchop and potatoes
He ain‚Äôt been online in forever
Destroy it
That works too
Oh no
Man boutta lift up Atlantis
Dinnertime

i return from dinner
the grindset must commense
commence
idea
split the v
have it slam in from both sides
wheel spins in
like the wheel spins as it moves in to look like it‚Äôs being attached
I was thinking it moves from like
Behind where the camera is
Forwards to the v
ye
Like
*insert shine/glint*
correct
because of bearing instability
you can make a rope out of them
Exactly how I envisioned it
Just could use a little more oomph
Less linear of easing
Ye the v looks a little static
Maybe a bounceOut
It‚Äôs been so long that I forget how to do easing without code
Bounce ease, out
Sus
Can you use code easing in blender
I have a function for a bounce out
R&D will also use this mod to power its mechs
we‚Äôre planning a way to do it without having it be 1. Shit or 2. Laggy
So definitely not the way aero does it
Clockwork is features for create that power vs2 stuff
Why are you using takeoff balloons
And why so many
Hola
Life good
Takeoff error
sails don‚Äôt save
Kekw
I do need to fix that
It is
Rather baller
Enable in config
But it‚Äôs buggy so
It‚Äôs disabled for a reason by default
Experimental
Damn
main menu, mods, click on eureka, click config
Create can‚Äôt configure them
Create has its own configuration system
Some mods support it
we do not
because theirs is pretty and clean
Ig
Also can be edited on the fly in world
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
damn
So I can just say
‚ÄúFuck you all‚Äù
Turn off stabilization
And watch an armada drop
Or do whatever the fuck constant did before
He swapped out invariant force with torque in eureka stabilize
And made a dradle
Infinite speen
Shut up
gradle has corrupted my spelling brain
:diesofdeath:
Lmfao
It lurks in every corner
gradle
I wake up in the morning
I forget to gradle clean
Hop off the bed
Clip through the floor
My liver stops working because it fails to find a resource that exists
My heart crashes because it can‚Äôt find SimpleFlowingFluid
And then I die
Java 17 is the requirement for modern mc isn‚Äôt it
No no
I don‚Äôt have that either
I know because I went on a quest for it
And it did not exist
Just download Java 17 from oracle
^
perfect
Mekapi is for vehicles made out of physics objects
Ironic that an assumedly aero fan is calling a mod that isn‚Äôt out fake
When
We are out
And aero ain‚Äôt
ü§®
Because all the negative comments on that are aero fans, so my brain ropes him in with the crowd
>vs2 channel
>aero Stan fanbase
Makes sense
I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs
Good looking or disgusting
I have no idea
I can explain a little better
Clockwork is not aero
Clockwork is a create addon
The only similarities are a side effect
Of being a create addon
You can‚Äôt do a create propellor in a ton of different ways for example
It‚Äôs a propellor and it speen
but clockwork‚Äôs plans do not align with aero‚Äôs design plans
Beyond a propellor
Wings that work even if they‚Äôre on create contraptions
That‚Äôs like 4 things
Out of
A whole lot
But I don‚Äôt wanna spoil everything lmao
Because vsified contraptions will have slightly different properties
Create contraptions are an example of Expected Behavior
if you have a wing on a create contraption
And you tilt it
Correct
Different use cases
Physics is based
:Thonk:
No idea
just make a creative world?
https://tenor.com/view/eating-magnets-gif-19614987
:guh: @Ralf2oo2
hinges have a break value
mojang sucks at making their own game
i wouldnt trust them to make a physics engine
should
the grindset of propellors continues
Rango with early access clockwork is less promotion for us and more promotion for himself :trol:
logs?
Use rubidium instead
the grindset is real today
been coding since 11am kill me please
me when i set arbitrary deadlines for myself and then go "oi who the fuck decided on that date"
and then i remember
it was me]
:clueless:
made an entire complex model, trying to kick objs into cooperating
If I punt them hard enough they will
Triode‚Äôs handling propellor math fixes
Usually it‚Äôs json
But
I‚Äôm using obj for a complex model
Cause I don‚Äôt want to use geckolib‚Äôs bullshit
:clueless:
Also no more dependencies
Create fabric already has like 8
Forge can handle it natively
But neither will cooperate for items
:3drevenge:
Yeah
You‚Äôll see it soon
Well you‚Äôll get to use it because you‚Äôre in early access
But
You‚Äôll probably see it in the next video of whoever we give it to lmfao
rango btw i dm'd you something
neurons firing
yeah?
that's bluperglue
its glue
but bluper
i've explained the logistical problem many times
and no actually, we have a glue handler that works with both glues
the only thing is that you dont want to assemble a ship with normal glue
because the contraptions on your ship are using normal glue-
bluper is the highest quality
crafted with bluu guu
:clueless:
ü§®
propellor working mostly
math a little suspicious
but
triode workin on it
the unspecified and secret extra addition is going well
wings work i think
i havent tested them in a hot minute
lmfao
i should test them again
who said anything about not being able to angle wings?
triode may or may not have been getting wings to work natively on normal create contraptions
:clueless:
not even vsified
normal
also
they dont have a top and bottom
wings don't work like that
that makes zero sense
no thatd be vs1 rudder level
math ‚ú®
vertical wings work and have been used on multiple contraptions
so obviously no they dont have an up and down
It would‚Äôve only taken one hour if I
Didn‚Äôt half asleep stumble around a single line error for 30 minutes
And then use the wrong variable in another
For another 15
:E_sleepdeprived:
Me: ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôm gonna name this *getFlapSpeed()* so I don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs not the same as normal speed‚Äù
Me, an hour later: *why is getSpeed() making it spin*
speaking of this
bro i am absolutely terrible at flying
i stalled like a bitch
LMFAO
i made a plane that worked really well
and then
i crashed it seven hundred times
there is only one way fitting to do this
hold on
there's gonna be a new thing
in clockwork channel soon
I crashed it twelve times
LMFAO
nah
correct
its stall speed is a bit sus tho
oh wait a sec
i just realized why i keep crashing
im on a redstone ready world so im probably pretty high up y level wise
i may have made the thrust gradient fucked again
we will still have create flight before aero :clueless:
nah
cringe
we release when we want
we arent a rival to aero
doesn't valkyrien computers have a way to get the world pos
im pretty sure it does
thats not even remotely
it will be compatible
nah its just gonna be a bit
?
shouldnt care what platform you're on
mekapi :trol:
https://imgur.com/Sx7NOhH
considering this
they seem more like
bonk
clockwork planes have actual wing math
and also have to fly at ludicrous speed
since they arent cheating
to stay in the air
losing momentum is a death sentence for a clockwork plane
im gonna try to make like a fighter plane next
that's quick at turning without stalling
oh by the way
but as you can see from that video where i used redstone links
its evidently fine
clockwork props have stress math too
a lot more forgiving tho
i mean we've got stylized parts too
look at the plane
https://youtu.be/ybix8t-GuKM
those aint create sails
nah thatll be for the fighter jet
or eurobeat
actually 100% eurobeat
?
vs clockwork stalling is bullshit tbh
LMFAO
also it gets worse at altitude
everything shits the bed once you're over 198 y
and it completely craps out at 320
yeah but not with propellors
they're basically 5% efficient up there
blaze jets
:clueless:
thing is if you fly over world limit you can actually fly faster than chunks load
so
a jet engine works up there
you dont have to worry about the server keeping up
boutta call the blaze jet an "Afterblazer"
:clueless:
clockwork's jet is 100% having some proper eurobeat in its showcase
https://youtu.be/aO_OUiALDmI?t=62
timestamped
actually
the time should be 4:30
because i made an hour's worth of progress over this weekend
:clueless:
i wish we fucking weren't
magnet integral still not solved
:clueless:
also
of having something functional today
i must fulfill my end of the bargain elsewise
so

:trol:
le gravity gun
it's made out of a ripped apart physics infuser and some elbow grease
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1038344793979371530/1064293207665553470/gravitron.gif
its supposed to look like this but i didnt finish the partials
:trol:
its literally a torn apart physics infuser
turned into a gun
uses the same materials and colors
:clueless:
vs2 + vr is planned for mekapi
we want to be able to control mechs with vr :clueless:
its the funny
oh yeah right
hold on
yes
it has a stress limit
happens to have a stressometer visible on it right there
the meter
if that dial ever maxes out
:")
it should probably be 4:30
considering the sheer volume of progress over the weekend
but oh well
You can, that‚Äôs not the stress
The stress is when the constraint it uses to hold something reaches its breaking point
Aka an opposing force ripping it away from you
Two gravitrons pulling in opposite directions probably won‚Äôt break
As they have the same force
We were supposed to have a build for our early access testers today
üòî
Do something that makes you worth adding :clueless:
Haz will be one of them
Nono
We need you for flap bearings
And other stuff
Since we want to directly control them
And cc addon don‚Äôt do that
Well I mean giving computers access to precise angles would be
Based
*slowly turns to the ‚Äòpoon*
Haha fun fact
It already works
:clueless:
Prop flying
nah bro wdym
prop flying is a bonus
plus its not very easy, it takes some skill to pull off consistently
and you have to use the right type of block
too heavy and it wont keep up, too light and itll flip you over
i can tell you with
100% certainty
it is the latter two
i cant pilot for shit and i had far too much control surface to actual wing ratio
also my wings maybe possibly were in the wrong direction
if you look at the video
when i pull up
it should be a
V
but instead its a
/  /
oh
their speed is based off their input rpm
i just had it set to 64
they dont care about rotation direction just rotation speed
i used a redstone linked controller for it
i have two redstone links on each flap
one set to trigger both sides for pitch
and one set to trigger the sides inverted for roll
and then if i combine both
bound to a and d
which isnt right
but i ran out of keybinds
LMFAO
i need to make like an "expanded"
linked controller
with more inputs
correct
but really id want to control the rudder seperately
from the ailerons
well i can just make a controller with like
the entire left half of your keyboard as input
lol
also I can maybe give it a throttle function for analog signals
incorrect
new lod brings friction
wheel bearings will become relevant
you wont be able to take off sliding your ship's ass against the ground
nono that has a use
center of mass
because your gear are minecraft block scale
so they will definitely make your center of mass move
ice is heavy as shit my guy
you dont really want ice wheels
also being slippery is not a good trait of landing gear
i sure do love trying to land and sliding off the edge of the carrier
:clueless:
wheel bearings will probably "brake" with redstone input
so youll have a way to slow the fuck down
and hopefully not do a frontflip in the process
well vsified versions of all contraptions are planned
the only exception is the bearing squad
because all bearings can be condensed into a single vsified bearing
they all serve very similar purposes
you can do that with a create contraption bearing with wings on it already
wings work on normal create contraptions thanks to triode
well a hinge is just a bearing from the side
if you think about it
:Thonk:
ill consider it
seems annoying to add but
not totally impossible
YO HOLD ON A MINUTE I JUST OPENED BLOCKBENCH

BRO
CUSTOM CURVES
geckolib can eat my shorts
because blender crashes every five minutes
/j
but actually it's just not the same vibe imo
blender is one of those programs where you NEED to save every like
5 seconds
why DOES geckolib exist
it shouldnt
because forge already supports obj animations natively
doesnt need a lib
and porting lib does it for fabric
forge has supported obj since like
forever
it has mesh animation support im pretty sure
could be wrong
fuck if i know
ive just seen a lot of mesh animated forge mods in the past
no
i have a vague idea of what you mean
and no
thats not what i was talking about
also that doesn't use mesh animations
its still json
theres a way to
well
kinda
gecko is an imitation of bedrock's system
but they did actually port molang, the animation method
just the way its rendered is totally different
yes it is
they ported the animation capabilities of it

LOOK AT TUE PLANE
the Idiot‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
You are one of the chosen
:trol:
Well in your case
Perhaps hold your patience
wooo
What
No mekapi just uses them
They‚Äôre in base vs
Well will be
Or still as wings
The idiot proved they do work
They‚Äôre just a bit sus
A tad suspicious
Make the bad piggies sound effects on crash landing
Trol
I mean i guess But that would have to assume all fluids are the same weight
Remember the potato cannon rhino turret
Look up nerf rhino
And imagine that firing potatoes at 200 tpm
Destroy things with potatoes
It‚Äôs create logic
You can tear shit up with tubers
It will support all potato cannon ammo types probably
Oh god imagine melon seeds
Buckshot turret
Well that‚Äôs already a thing
In create
I‚Äôm just saying imagine it full auto
Maybe I‚Äôll add like creeper cornflakes that are explosive rounds
Trol
Minecraft cereal as funny boom round
If I had to guess
I‚Äôd say the current planned content I could finish by March
Of course the current planned content doesn‚Äôt reflect our end goal of content
We want a lot more then like 20 blocks
But i feel like once the mod is in a polished state we can have a 1.0 release
And then I can do content updates like create does
:clueless:
Ye
Smh
never
Tpk porting vs2 back to 1.12 only for fluid simulation to be added after he already ported
So far clockwork just has üÖ±Ô∏èlanes
Soon it‚Äôll have üÖ±Ô∏èlimps and üÖ±Ô∏èautomobiles
When new lod
For surface velocity
:clueless:
Clockwork features mostly waiting on lod tbh
Waiting on better water occlusion
Not using shitty sealed rooms
Fluid sim :trol:
Like planes needing wheels on their landing gear
And not just being able to
Slide across the floor to take off
Well there is no friction rn
That‚Äôs the issue
Well there is some form of drag
I think
funny logic for funny things
Essentially krunch blockstates
Friction, bounciness, adhesion maybe
Also once I‚Äôm home today I really need to build a plane that doesn‚Äôt fly like shit
Cause the idiot is
Well
The Idiot
I said I was gonna add stuff to clockwork
Smh
It‚Äôll have cannons and shit
But no lead and gunpowder guns
It just doesn‚Äôt fit create
mic it‚Äôs a create addon you clown
Ah yes let me just grab my steampunk Russian rpg
Cbc is not lead and gunpowder what
Cbc is Victorian tier cannons
They take seven hours to load manually
The autocannon is sus and doesn‚Äôt fit with the rest of the mod
Imo
But when i say lead and gunpowder weapons
I mean I‚Äôm not giving yall an ak-77
And saying ‚Äústeampunk‚Äù
Probably
Fuck you I‚Äôll go full portal 2 and spring load my bullets /j
Reload animation
*slams literal cannonball into literal hand cannon*
*arm disconnects*
That‚Äôs where the ‚Äòtato autocannon comes in
The fuck you mean joystick control
My guy this is minecraft just plug in a joystick and remap it to wasd
I‚Äôm not making controllable a dependency just for the two people who own a joystick to use
:diesofdeath:
You can
Have you seen the Idiot
https://youtu.be/ybix8t-GuKM
Map it to wasd
You clown
I‚Äôm not adding analog control to mc
I don‚Äôt want to make controllable a dependency
For mekapi sure it will probably since the whole point of mekapi is vehicles
Controller support for mc
Supports analog input
Yeah but it‚Äôs the best implementation by far
controllable that is
Regardless it feels odd to make support for such a niche controller for a niche situation
Not like a controller joystick this man is talking a
Plane joystick
:E_sleepdeprived:
The hard part isn‚Äôt even getting the input it‚Äôs just converting it to something create gives a rats ass about
Redstone signal strength aint it
Lame
And not create style
:3drevenge:
What even is that
Why do you ask
Are you asking me to code your mod
It‚Äôs all based on create stuff so no probably not
Wing code is in vs2 tho
I wanna work on mekapi but
Ruby still no has
Physic obj
Uhhhh
You‚Äôre gonna want to up the strength of those shit motors
They can‚Äôt power a decent sized propellor probably
They‚Äôll maybe handle a small one at medium speed tho
Or just use multiple
Yes
Combustion Engine
We‚Äôre making a scalable engine called the combustion engine
After all we want to support small compact craft
That‚Äôs kinda the point lol
Tileable
In any direction
That‚Äôs the plan anyways
As long as they‚Äôre connected in some abstract way they‚Äôll treat eachother like neighbors
Dear god
Combustion engine shaped combustion engine
ü§®
Based
I really need to get you that build
Soon
Haz is our resident contraption genius
Actually has
Do you know the YouTuber Musca
Wh
Autocorrect
Mysda
mysda makes crazy create contraptions
He was talking the other day
I wonder if he and you would get along
Die
@Dapheni actually he;s in this server
Holy shit I just saw the amount of people that have joined recently
The two goodly builders are in a room
We‚Äôre all doomed
Runs on liquid fuel
Dapheni mentioned possibly making a rube goldberg machine with vs2
And haz has made quite a few
so
:trol:
They can in some ways
But they don‚Äôt have full collision
you can use vs2 stuff to influence create more than the other way around
Take a look in the channel with a clock icon
However with clockwork you‚Äôll be able to vs-Ify contraptions
I believe
Nah I did
Haz made a better plane
Than the Idiot
Bro the idiot can‚Äôt even fly straight without stalling
It has to be on a tilt to stay upright
LMAO
nah but that‚Äôs sus as hell
Triode added wings that don‚Äôt need that but I don‚Äôt have a model for them
And they‚Äôre directional so they‚Äôre harder to implement
I think
Fabric would if create contraptions loaded on ships in fabric
:trol:
Ye just no proper engines
Other than takeoff farters
Bruuhh
Just use multi mc and modrinth trol
Too bad my clockwork plane is the opposite of controllable
Lmfao
the idiot flies like it‚Äôs namesake
Uplifting üòä
‚ÄúIf you fuck up now, you‚Äôll keep fucking up‚Äù
rendering
it exists and runs fine but
no ship visible
ships do exist tho
they just dont rneder
mekapi is gonna have vr support so it'll need to get fixed
:slurp:
ewou did this
blame him
bro what is that scuffed ass propellor setup you got goin
LMFAO
budget cock
also btw planes are so fast rn that they
kinda need to fly above world height
so they can go faster than chunkloading
but they also cant fly up there because props
i need to add the Afterblazer to clockwork
but
later
after first ea build
speaking of which
i also need to make props fall off in speed
or thrust
at high speed
LMAO
nono but planes are
too fast
you misunderstand
a propellor should not travel at 100 meters per second
*a propellor with 8 blade blocks*
a propellor with a stress cost of 2048 is capable of going near sonic speed
thats not
right
nono not rpm fast
like
thrust fast
it gets too fast and since it doesnt fall off at high velocity
it just keeps getting faster
ye
i need good math for that tho
well realistically we want it lower because you want to be able to fly your plane around shit in mc without
absconding
not aero plane speeds thats a travesty
but like
not sonic
LMFAO
sure
bet
we dont wanna look like this tho üíÄ
https://imgur.com/Sx7NOhH
fuckin antigravity lookin asses
correct but it also does a
beyblade spin
and recovers
aero doesnt have proper wing physics
not like this anyways
it has nerfed wings so that the slow planes can sustain flight
exactly, if im not lagging the game with how fast i move while dogfighting
whats the point?
lmfao
thats just cause farters
theres no real way to slow down
or control thrust
the afterblazer over y=320 will get a free boost up in effectiveness level
essentially
the afterblazer will have a third stage you can only reach over 320
no
thats why over world height is required for blaze
if you're over world height you dont need to
load
chunks
thats already a thing afaik
hence why im making the jet lol
yes
except in liftoff where le engine block can go above
admittedly shit in clockwork stops working up there too
propellors fall to 5% effectiveness so good luck flying
balloons top out
combustion engines will not last at that altitude
but we have actual alternatives for high altitude flight
so its not debilatating
that's not the most practical altitude
most practical is y=198
i calculated it
yes
which is why jet
you use jet
you dont use propellor for that
actually youd think that but
when they actually have a speed cap no
magic ‚ú®
the other half of create
create is steampunk + magic
so the magical side, aka blaze burners, is what im using as a jet
fittingly
800kmh is 222.2 meters per second
which is
about the speed the prop plane can get to before it starts to lag
:clueless:
thats 200 blocks per second
its just barely possible
on servers hell no tho
i mean i had the Idiot's prop at 256 speed like a dumbass
and i hit the point where chunk lag started
fabric only
üòî
but ruby might port
both
it gens faster and loads faster
because mojang
github
backport it
pregenned worlds :diesofdeath:
:diesofdeath:
well anyways
i gotta figure out how to do it best tho
i dont wanna do a Me Gradient‚Ñ¢Ô∏è because you know how takeoff balloons went
and i found the air pressure math online
sure but propellors will not be intended for flying over 320
you have a jet for that
because the math is set
its not easy to config
uses arbitrary numbers that i dont wanna do more math to get
thats not what i mean :clueless:
well no i have an actual air pressure thing for height
roughly
because its funny
and it also means they arent 0% effective past their limit
just 5% effective
with really light blocks and big props it may be possible
the majority of your ship would be a skeleton with steam engines
probably made out of wool
youd DEFINITELY need a reaction wheel setup
probably multiple
for cancelling the torque the propellor-that's-heavier-than-your-plane would cause
:clueless:
propellors cause spin
plane usually cancels out
but
without much plane to plane
yes but not broken like that
they do actually
just only when imbalanced
we were working on thinking of how to make them apply torque all the time but
since no actual aerodynamics
would make plane spin too much
wings wouldnt stop it
yeah cause not real aerodynamics
fluid sim when, then itll work
they do but not like
you can see in the idiot video
when you have enough of them
it kills all your speed
but you need quite a bit
its why i stalled out entirely pulling up
might work if your plane isnt large
but if your plane is idiot sized or larger you'll need more
and either way it isnt enough to counteract the sheer torque that a large prop would apply
speaking of limiting speed
triode do you know non-sus math for making props produce less thrust when going at mach
my air pressure math isnt too sus but
i dont wanna reuse it
seems ü§®
i mean technically we have an exhaust velocity
the airstream
they do produce an airstream
do you want a walkthrough :clueless:
ill join a vc
aight
i do need to make ponders
but like
i wish there was a blockbench ponder animator...
ewou fixing packet garbagh
cringe
you know thats breaking discord tos right :clueless:
delta doesnt count he's our local ai
it is a self bot
you're using a bot to send messages as a user
webhook still counts dipshit
no
its also using a bot user as a not bot
ew
It breaks clockwork :haha:
Found that out the fun way
They changed rendering shit **again**
Literally every version increment they break everything
I don‚Äôt understand
https://youtu.be/ybix8t-GuKM
That‚Äôs not takeoff
Yeah
That‚Äôs clockwork lol
Yeah
It was in the clockwork channel and it says so in the description
Real actually
Triode got wings working by default on create contraptions
It‚Äôs pretty based
The flap bearing from clockwork makes it significantly easier
He was stunned by how disorganized create code is üíÄ
They have their own math classes
Horrific
Farted your expectations
:clueless:
:Thonk:
New vs logo huh
:hmm:
By any chance is anyone already taking up that torch
Ahh
I thought they were making the clockwork logo tho
Funky
damn üòî
I shall find my opportunity elsewhere
Fair enough
I may make one anyways just for gits and shiggles
:guh:
I‚Äôll doodle the logo idea I had once I‚Äôm home
It‚Äôs mostly truthful to the current while not being a random wheel model from online lol
I stg
Did three people just suggest that at once
Like physical turbines?
That it doesn‚Äôt exist :trol:
I live
Temporarily
:diesofdeath:
Just download it off github
GRAVITIZED
:slurp:
Why did ewou name this emoji slurp ü§®
Man gets grabbed by the gravitron and you just hear like a straw
Cause he‚Äôs banned
Obviously
Based
Cope
No way
Ignore him he‚Äôs a bit slow
He asks for progress on r&d every few days like somethings gonna happen before ventities are done
Nutdealer
Fitting considering
The Idiot
That‚Äôs smaller than a slab
https://youtu.be/ybix8t-GuKM
The plane is named the idiot
Because it flies like one
Oh lord
I wish mercy on your soul koap
üíÄ
Look at the uploader
That‚Äôs the other immersive portals port
:3drevenge:
That‚Äôs Ryan‚Äôs mod
That‚Äôs why it wouldn‚Äôt work
Tracky is their chunk loading thing
It‚Äôs made with Ryan‚Äôs chunkloading thing
That‚Äôs why it won‚Äôt be compatible
üíÄ
It‚Äôs using tracky
Aka
One of the create simulated parts
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs using the rendering method aero uses as it‚Äôs on aero‚Äôs chunkloading thing
tracky
Aero has like 3 parts for some reason
I mean how much of the code is really unfamiliar /j
:trol:
requires a good RPM input to run
and takes decent stress
maybe when vsbodies :clueless:
correct, hence why its one reaction wheel orientation
youll need 3 minimum to fully lock rot
but for like a plane
you dont need all 3
SAS moment
?
stabilization
Reaction wheels are designed to stabilize
it works essentially like ksp SAS
so
your original guess was right
and reaction wheels arent eureka stabilization level
they dont upright you
they just stop a spin
because it's cooler like this :clueless:
no
they dont stabilize you like eureka
they actually stabilize you
skill issue, probably
thats because 3rpm is so piss weak it couldnt move the Idiot
more than that‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
honestly the math for it is
a little suspicious
no, actually
i wont spoil why it jumped
no idea
yeah debug wings
they're better than takeoff ones lol
but no farter
:diesofdeath:
i think it works tho
haz did plane
with takeoff farters
bro
you're gonna stratosphere yourself
if thatll even run without a creative motor that is
thats a LOT of wings
wait actually
im not even sure you can fly that
how tall is it
propellors start to fall off at around y=256 and they drop to 5% efficiency at world height
you might need jets for that shit bruh
they dont stop spin
they react to spin
big difference
you can spin
they will stop your spin after you stop trying to spin
simple
but most deliberate sources of torque
will be stronger than them
:3dsus:
it's a re-action wheel
it doesn't act
it reacts
when a torque is applied it will attempt to counteract said torque
whenever a spin is happening, its trying to stop it
but it has limited power in stopping said spin
^^^
reactionwheels are passive gyros
an active gyro is what we'll have for mega airships
yes
multiblock
obliterated
They aren‚Äôt entities in any way
He actually replaced his heart with a proxy
All compat stuff will be in base vs
Once clockwork is ready
I mean the c*ock did jump an hour and a half ahead
They came out with a 0.5h
And it broke shit again
üíÄ
But g should work
Yes but broke render mixins again
I stg
Every update
I don‚Äôt get it
What are they even changing
So true
The spaghetti code as well
^^^
Mojank ain‚Äôt got nothin on Create: Steam-Boilerplate
there‚Äôs so much boilerplate code
They have their own math classes for some ungodly reason
Oh yeah that was really fun
Replacing every unique distance check with a vs equivalent
Because they don‚Äôt just use a vanilla distance check
Flywheel moment
Ah yes
The god it gives you
the code is god
The kraken
The almighty Kraken in Krunch
You don‚Äôt really want your armor stand flying around your room when your airship has a bit of a rough landing
I mean
If you want crazy, there will be addons for crazy
Base vs shouldn‚Äôt have that for people who don‚Äôt want their paintings to abscond away when they make a rough landing
Armor stands are entities
Entities don‚Äôt have physics
For now
They do on takeoff
Listen I may or may not have set my own weapons system on fire
So
its too effective
The flamethrower is literally just death
My shitty little plane had crazy control
They can confirm
I could do a backflip on a dime
And it did have yaw control actually I just never used it :clueless:
It had a rudder?
Oh you mean big Bertha
The little shit mk2 had a rudder
If discord would send a message
For the little shit, very
It was hyper maneuverable
the little shit flew around theirs quite a few times
:clueless:
Front flaps could be disabled for more stability with slightly slower turning
I did it at first but I realized I wanted to style point backflip
Yes
The unfortunate thing imo is
Cbc autocannons seem to be bugged rn
They cause you to get delayed after riding for a while
On a ship
Like desync
You get desynced on the physics thread somehow
I don‚Äôt think the autocannon is actually in the shipyard
Might be a different contraption type
I‚Äôll look into it
Autocannon
It‚Äôs an AA gun
You can see it on the little shit
I‚Äôll say this
Me and nameless tested
I did
I have the entire fight recorded
From my pov
Including all the vc
Bro I still find it so funny
Me and nameless thought the fight was over
we were just flyin to go repair
Meanwhile they were trying to stay airborne as if the battle was still raging
LMAO
The result of low render distance
The second fight will have high
If only distant horizons worked with vs
üòî
Maybe I could look into fixing it if it‚Äôs not too complicated
Would like a log
Actually forge takeoff may be borked I‚Äôm unsure
Hovercraft work
Waiting on lod and vsbodies for wheels tho
You misunderstand the sheer amount of thrust that little shit plane has
It uses 8620 SU
:trol:
Ye
No survival there yet
I still need to program the combustion engine
So we can have compact planes
Dogfight
Scroll up
Well that large of a propellor shouldn‚Äôt be required for a plane that light but you see
I added a speed cap to propellors by calculating their exhaust velocity
They can‚Äôt go faster than it
And I didn‚Äôt tune it well so they‚Äôre a bit piss weak when small
I just gotta tweak the numbers around
Yeah it does
Nah that is relying HEAVILY on the creative motor
Also that create blocks have default weight values rn
I need to edit them
Actually
That‚Äôs where the prop bearing comes in
It operates at double speed
The propelllor spins twice as fast as the input rpm
512 rpm with a propellor that has sails 4 meters in length and a meter in diameter
That would definitely do something
Plus for game balance reasons we can‚Äôt really make the create speed limit any higher
time to add tiers :clueless:
Props need more thrust to offset their absurd costs lol
I‚Äôll work on it
According to create balance there technically should be :clueless:
An andesite tier and a brass tier
Without wings the torque would make your plane go brrrr
Yeah but they also didn‚Äôt have props several meters long
It‚Äôs Minecraft, everything is a meter
:clueless:
Superheat
If you want hyper realism wait for takeoff to get properly developed or wait for mekapi
Clockwork is abiding by create balance first and foremost
We already do pretty accurate propellor math and falloff
I‚Äôd say that makes up for it
reaction wheel isn‚Äôt really balance it‚Äôs more ‚Äústop your uncontrolled spin‚Äù
Well takeoff has a damn
Integral
For its magnet calculation
Because that addon is all about overcomplexity
Still haven‚Äôt solved it btw
Been 4 weeks
:clueless:
Shitty version of them are
We have a proper magnetic field and force calc
But we have to solve an integral that is just
Complete bullshit
Wolfram even punts you
It‚Äôs the idea
Coilguns were the inspiration for magnets
Trol
It‚Äôs not technically a railgun because it‚Äôd be most effective with sequenced coils of magnet blocks
Exactly
Potato battery moment
Ewou made an electrical flow graphing system for potato battery and it is sitting unused
And it makes me sad every time
But clockwork priority
then takeoff and pb
Takeoff would be more coilgun than railgun
Which in our case a coil is far easier and probably more effective in mc
Potato Battery electricity would be threaded but you‚Äôd still probably rather the lenience a coil system would give you over a straight rail
You can make a coil of blocks
It‚Äôd be a mix of both really
Me when takeoff development is bottom of my todo list
üòî
I have too much to do lmao
I gotta develop clockwork and then work on mekapi so I can work on r&d and then I‚Äôll hopefully be good enough at braining to go back to potato battery and takeoff
Well rn it wouldn‚Äôt work, gotta wait for triode to add impact damage
I think he said it would be after lod
For now tho you could shoot an iron rod with explosives strapped to it
Well you can‚Äôt
Shoot it now anyways lol
Not yet
They‚Äôre planned to be as #stardust will rely on them
Valkyrien in SPAAAAAAAaaaaceeee
but it‚Äôs gonna come out around the time the universe hits heat death because it wants a semi real scale solar system
Dynamic Connectivity
Is planned‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
That‚Äôll allow for ship splitting that isn‚Äôt laggy
It‚Äôs just a bit of a problem to solve
Like two lmfao
Ship splitting in the way most would think to do it is really slow and laggy and we don‚Äôt do slow and laggy in vs2
Aero has a massive team ngl
It‚Äôs like 7
That‚Äôs a lot
We have Ruby and triode and copper an ewou
So four on the main mod
Then the addons
I‚Äôm working on clockwork‚Äôs content with some assistance from Dust and Ewou, and with Ruby fixing stuff
Stardust is being programmed by ender who lives in China and can‚Äôt use discord half the time, and has an artist going through a stage of mental insanity
Islands is waiting on the api
Too many
Which is ironic as it‚Äôs engine is more complex than pretty much any of its contemporaries
Yes
He‚Äôs going insane permanently
If you think our clockwork planes are a bit unrealistic how do you feel about 5 mile an hour planes or blocks that stabilize for you
people harp on eureka for being free stabilization but aero‚Äôs main thing *is* levitite
Which is free stabilization
Nah it‚Äôs aerial drag
It doesn‚Äôt produce lift
No lift :noelele:
Do tell
Oh right haz can‚Äôt see it
Just say it in ea
Not here lol
He already has it
:trol:
I think clockwork is very create styled
Totally not just saying that because I made it
But Ive been told I am pretty good at mimicking the create art style
murder plots in general
We‚Äôve fulfilled a daily quota
Steam and rails turning into a simulated addon was literally like
Okay then
I‚Äôm aware
Slap on the ksp building music
We going to space
Honestly my most anticipated thing about vs2 has to be vsbodies but they‚Äôre also the thing that‚Äôll take the longest because vs2 essentially needs to be rewritten to accept shit other than a ship
But mech

Incorrect
But mechs use ü§®
That‚Äôs a spring
üòî
:diesofdeath:
Alright
No more clockwork
Or throwing klarkson around like a ragdoll
Not that kind of vr
Real vr control
Levers and interactive pieces of the cockpit
Mekapi plans to have vr interactive parts

Bro your liver
I feel bad
R&D mechs will be customizable too tho
How did you manage
Breaking things is one
Making Rube Goldberg machines is the other
Still waiting on floater powered plane
:clueless:
And a simulated gearshift
So you could have enough speed
Smh
That‚Äôs what I thought :3drevenge:
That‚Äôs not right
Every second you‚Äôre not running clockwork 0.1 gets closer
Let‚Äôs goo
I just realized that the autocannon in rango‚Äôs thumbnail is
Pointing at the back of my head
https://youtu.be/INw7lDciv6Y
‚ÄúFLY MOTHERFUCKER FLY‚Äù
The makeshift flamethrowers on the front of our craft worked really well until you realize that
Putting makeshift and flamethrower In the same sentence
You‚Äôre bound to run into some problems eventually
Nah bro we were going ultralight
I need to work on stuff for mega airships but
Planes being perfected more important imo
You see clockwork brings a lot of create bugfixes
One of them is creative motors not actually updating server side
The numbers will change clientside but they won‚Äôt update so the speed will never change
For now just use a gearshift
Can count the pixels
They don‚Äôt save
That‚Äôs why
Here we go again
@Kilo question, who is kwizzle again
Soon
Nono I mean REALLY soon
Like
Really fucking soon
3 weeks and working planes
I‚Äôd consider that a dub
No but I mean really
Soon
:Thonk:
Send link
I will attempt to contact him
:trol:
Put in server
Launch

guh
Modlist?
Does kwizzle have a discord? I have no way of contacting this man otherwise
Except maybe leaving a YouTube comment and praying
@KwizzleHazzizle Hola si senor
I pinged him but he has DND on so 50/50 chance of seeing

Vs2 borg when
@OutCraft your time has come /j
Someone‚Äôs making a drone with clockwork
lmfao
I Really need to fix the wing connectivity bug
But it‚Äôs very :3drevenge:
It‚Äôs called Essential
Closer
We‚Äôre approaching the tipping point
Yeah
*Subtle*

Sup
I‚Äôve been told you made a video about vs2
You make create videos and made a few vs2 ones
Sussy baka
Version, modlist, log
That ain‚Äôt even a vs2 thing
Blocky siege shat the bed
Oh cause it‚Äôs an mcreator mod
üíÄ
I‚Äôm saying
What modlist
Send log
The log is workable
Crash log?
That log doesn‚Äôt even seem to make it past loading
Does your game even load
The shaft shouldn‚Äôt prevent your entire game from loading
You aren‚Äôt even in the world
Eureka moment
It doesn‚Äôt like constraints
This is why you don‚Äôt use eureka trol
Preparing for blastoff
The latest log you posted just says something about waila
It doesn‚Äôt seem to contain a crash
Clockwork has something better
Every single contraption type
Will be vsifiable
Including trains
What version of create
Seperate branch as it‚Äôs very very annoying to do
Version of vs2?
Oh bruh

You‚Äôre 4 versions behind

Beta 9 moment
It is a bug
Skull emoji
It‚Äôs okay I struck back
I put create aeronautics in the description of the Flight of the Idiot video
:trol:
Yeah it‚Äôs fucked
But are you surprised
They play underhanded all the time
What video is that
guh
Bro
They actually tagged all their aero shit with eureka üíÄ
The actual cope

Oh shit mischief of mice
What‚Äôs his discord name
Oh
Oka discord
Send that five minutes late
They‚Äôre super smooth

It flies well because it‚Äôs entirely control surfaces
90% of its weight is wings and flaps
Guh
Me when vs1
I remember
My og account did join this server only ten days after Ruby did :clueless:
I‚Äôve seen the past

not a priority compared to clockwork
the sequenced seat model i showed off actually is mostly done being programmed already, but I am too tired rn to add the model to the actual block so rn the ingame version forgor to install CS: Source üíÄ
i am
literally
guh
it was all rights reserved?
nah bro before it was closed it was LGPL
just opened up the forked repo
lmfao
ahh
well thats landlord
i mean like aero itself
was lgpl at one point
#support
my heart and actions are utterly unclouded
they are that of c*ockwork
im paid in the satisfaction that it works
eat sleep clock repeat
im sick rn so i didnt get to code anything today
just spat out a half-awake chair model
and then went back to lying down
bleh
nah bro im chillin
:Gun_But_Better:
this is americ
guh
cant be as evil as nameless's void-inator
nameless made
using a sloped block mod
a rail that looked like it was flat
but it was actually
going down a slope
so if you got in a minecart and rode it
it would accelerate
and drop you through the world
We thought of it while theorycrsfting ways to control a small plane
Localized
Wasd > lua
Manual control
*cracks knuckles in create mod knowledge*
*snaps hand off at 0.5h*
Socketwrench
no i just like lime
:D
lime and purple are two favorite colors
LMFAO
yes
the most important vsified contraptions imo are the bearing ones
and trains
thats about it
everything else doesn't benefit a *ton* from being shipified
jumpin trains
renai transportation
jumpin train
you know they already push mobs right
there will be crash damage eventually
ye?
you can stand on contraptions on ships
its planned
physics trains
its just a constraint that follows the rail
not that hard
actually if we want the train to derail
we kinda need to figure out a different method
but like
thats 0.2 earliest feature anyways
not a launch feature
0.2 will be about land and sea
and 0.3
but we will keep updating
haha
as long as we have suggestions and ideas
we'll keep adding stuff
clockwork gonna be real feature complete eventually
soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
actually no
remove that tm
just soon
i think youd be able to make a vsbody act as a wing
and you wouldnt want your entire vehicle to be one body
obv
so split the wing model into segments
have each segment count as a wing
that would also allow wing to break
which is neat
yeee
the big excite for me tbh is that mekapi will allow me to have R&D mechs be fully like
limb swappable
youll be able to snap on whatever and itll work
as its all just parts
grabbing your realistic plane with my mech
yeeting it
across the map
flans mod's days are indeed numbered
i mean have you seen even just clockwork flight
its hella stable
if a bit forgiving
do floaters have redstone control?
well kinda
the controller isnt actually very jank
it works very nicely
as shown in the dogfight video
that was entirely redstone controller driven
and we'll have a better controller soon that has more keybinds and a built in analog throttle
all physical
no prebake
prebake cringe
i mean hell mechs are gonna use an IK algorithm
to walk
why would we make props static
very
i promise their IK will be better than
https://tenor.com/view/eating-magnets-gif-19614987
also mekapi + vr =
flight sim in mc
:trol:
actually, i did find an open source flight sim library that might be useful for making mekapi planes even better
polygon collider but yes technically
about that
but its gonna need a polygon collider
for more complex stuff
so we'll have to work on the cars and bikes first
not that im complaining
i wanna make my stunt bike
fair but like
the mechs
üò≥
i mean yeah you could do it with a lot of boxes to be fair
i keep my mech models minecrafty
but it would be quite a lot of boxes
guh
literally anyhting is better
so
ye
also mekapi vehicles will allow you to flip upside down because vs2
which is like
half the reason im excited
you arent axis aligned constantly
cant wait to make the R&D Steamcycle
using the stunt bike template
so i can make a tony hawk pro skater style points system
for doing tricks midair
and have nixie tubes as the score counter
the scary part is that it might actually live up to the image of it in my head
:clueless:
you know how when you listen to game music you got that like imaginary fight scene in yo head
im listening to eurobeat
and i must realize it
for now
well with friction and by extension traction
we could do drifting
bro im excited for all of this shit and im gonna be making it :trol:
thats how cool the concepts for vs are smh
got even the devs hyped
im adding an obligatory steam whistle pulley
you know i gotta do it
bruh obj rendering in forge takes literally nothing
they were really complainin?
yes because obj rendering is piss easy
what is hard on performance is animated rigs
yes i have
i dont think the main mekapi planes will be as complex as flying an actual plane
im not interested in DCS because everything is just
bleh
funny because the instance rendered objs in flywheel actually lag me more
üíÄ
ruby i had no fps drop with placing 200 of my reaction wheel model
but my game slows down having just a few create flywheel blocks placed
nope! it's too much boilerplate for me to understand how
i just skipped the instancing system entirely
yes
it is
its coded horrifically
i animated them all (admittedly the animation was fucked up and off center) and no issue
block partials
:clueless:
the one good thing create does
i slapped a creative motor on all of them
the instancing engine works well for block models and when youve got stuff with like
6 partials
but
er
the reactcion wheels
i mean
yes
because i didnt want clipping
with the textures
so i used an octagon with proper faces
instead of cubes
ye
Porting Lib moment
thank alpha, it's technically better than forge's
natively supports item objs instead of casting a block to an item
but yeah create code is
bad
addons are worse typically
cbc is scuffed too
just less so
than other addons
i mean create deco doesn't even use registrate right
which makes it incompatible with clockwork rn
we're probably one of the neatest addons and considering we havent done proper cleanup yet thats kinda sad
half the create addons that you can actually download are mcreator
the rest are unfinished or total messes
clockwork definitely needs some cleanup
but
its not a travesty comparitively
listen its cleaner than create code :clueless:
and it all (mostly) works in common too
so we dont have to develop seperately for frogger and bricfab
frogger
:forge: üê∏
few reasons
main one polish
yes
because eureka proved
people will not appreciate ew unfinished
or ew simple
thats another
and theres a few more
but the main one is
ew unfinished bad
soon :trol:
i mean
our speed is unreasonable
sheer determination
fluffy nolifed the mixins and i nolifed the features for a while
i had a week off when we started
that got us like jumpstarted ahead
2 months is a large estimate my friend
note i said large estimate
big brain man right here
literally did a flap bearing any% speedrun the other day
the clockwork repo be like
>3 weeks
>
id say aero but they wont be out for months after we release
at the current rate
we'll be on update 0.2.5
and theyll be on
closed beta
version chasing
:3drevenge:
create mod is also actively devving for 1.18
i didnt
fluffy did
black magic, presumably
i may be capable of many things
but mixins are not one of them
thats all hoodoo to me
i think the principle is just to jump every 2 updates
LMFAO
i mean 1.20 disables autojump by default now
this is a victory to me
1.20 reorganized it
its much better
it has shit where youd expect it to be
rather than
all over
incorrect
it does invert
but gearboxes sussy rn
and im not sure why
just dont put the gearbox right next to the prop
put a shaft there inbetween
itll work
its cause of the way it grabs targetSpeed rn
and the sussy way gearboxes work
wdym
the reaction wheel?
thats not technically stabiliaztion
reaction wheels arent active stabilization
they stop spin
they dont orient
we are not using aero as design reference
their optical sensor runs on game thread
üíÄ
youd have performance anyways
the irony
of that joke
it just seems
sus
we will have a tilt thing
but
not a redstone sensor
thats a little too gimmicky
gyroscopic/weighted shaft
no
it changes direction based on how far it is from the world upright axis iirc
idk ask ewou
actually no hjes asleep
i knew it
what
nimbatus is 2d
those things dont work very well in a 3d space
guh
well no optical sensor ripoff for you
:clueless:
hellhounds round
because this is a sequenced gearshift using keybinds essentially
it can do more than just a controller
and sequenced gearshifts
complex physical mechanism are technically programming
actually
redstone is turing complete
so by extension create stuff possibly is
ahh
well you typically combine it with redstone
really, the best control system is gonna be pb electricity :clueless:
when i get around to making it
YOU'RE WRONG ACTUALLY
https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/gd5uyq/reprogrammable_turing_machine_using_create_114/
ITS BEEN TURING COMPLETE SINCE 1.14
i just googled "create turing machine"
and after scrolling past the
"how to make a turing machine"
i got to this
yet
:trol:
GUH
IT RISES
something tells me you're gonna enjoy PB whenever it comes out
potato battery
it's #takeoff's coremod, when takeoff will actually be its completed addon state
cause rn takeoff is le meme testbench but that's temporary
cope
:trol:
yes
no
instead i will model
an entire well made and highly polished jester outfit
and set it to render whenever your uuid uses the mod
:E_clown:
bro one whole schmeckle?
thats more than im gonna get paid for all of clockwork
pass it over
LMFAO
:diesofdeath:
its okay TPK will help me survive
he's gonna commission me
for models
for his mod\
speakingofwhichihavecommissionsopenpleaseiliketoeatandnotdie
implying im not already doing that
nah it is very overhyped tho
they've hyped it up as unlimited content
when its literally
all of its features fit in a discord emoji set
and most are niche or a little sussy
like
:optical_sensor:
seperate hinges
the physics thread doesn't desync
network is amazing
have you seen the stability on the dogfight
rango recorded that and he lives in australia
i live in the middle of america
üíÄ
and no stuttering
server host
null's server is just busted
don't use his aternos lookin ass
as reference
lmfao
guh
thats client host
even worse
Based
I‚Äôd join but I acruallt feel like total shit
Aero 5mph planes
Nah nah nah
not just that
the sails also have to be balanced
if your propellor isnt balanced itll cause crazy torque on your vessel
especially if its large
they spin at double rpm
and thats still only
512
rpm
which is nowhere near an actual propellor
nah sails dont have angles
problem with this tho
it shouldnt be at max speed
but we added a thing to stop props from gaining thrust at a certain point by calculating their exhaust velocity
and i didnt set it high enough
so their exhaust velocity is so low that if they arent at full tilt
they cant move shit
which obv is not intended lol
actually
the balancing math is really complex
as are propellors in general
they have smooth spinup and slowdown
balanced propellors, conservation of momentum, and an air pressure falloff
they have quite a lot
you see they're not very different because
a large and slow prop will have a very similar
stress req
to a fast and small prop
use takeoff hinges
or bearings
debug one doesnt save
shouldn't
just dont use takeoff wings
id make a backup anyways
takeoff's vs version is a bit out of date
config ‚ú®
wdym
it shouldnt desync ever
its all serverside rotation
that's a create question i cant answer
has nothing to do with us tho
vs2's networking is really good because it uses udp
create is normal mc networking
so i have no idea lol
vs2 does not have that problem
again rango lives in australia and he had no visible lag on the vs2 ships despite it being hosted in california
beta 10 is the version you should use
beta 9 is bugged
oh wait you mean takeoff
did someone update it?
i didnt lol
we really should push beta 10
ü§®
smooth in a server hosted across the world
laggy in singleplayer
makes about as much sense as anything else
:clueless:
he was the one recording
the one flying around with an elytra was triode i think?
wait no
triode was in the Big Bertha
he was trying to help pilot
yeah the Little Shit kinda shredded
that flamethrower dont mess around
literally as we ended up burning our own weapons systems off
they can gain momentum like elytras too since they have wing physics
if you dive down and pull up
you gain serious speed
we absolutely rolled them
weird
i dont recognize half of those mods tho, sorry
might wanna ask ruby
ye ik
im sayting the ones that are on
i have clockwork + eureka + takeoff + Valkyrien computers in a single mod folder
its like having almost all the infinity stones
now i just need R&D and stardust
i gotta finish clockwork's branding first :clueless:
clockwork logo approaches
cant wait to see a modpack with progression using all the vs addons
start off simple with eureka
and then finally
the space age
with stardust and mekapi space mechs
guh
gone
plane gone
Valkyrien Horizons
LMFAO
thats how the gravitron works
but real tp commands are approaching
also
sudden constraint movement can cause some
...instability
*looks at gravitron ship erasing*

the infuser doesnt do anything beyond infusing
could also be spinning in wrong direction
are you using wings or flaps?
:Thonk:
ayy
flight
uh oh
the multiplayer bounding box bug found its way into singleplayer
that usually is fixed via relog
with farters?
it shouldnt
i dunno
balloons dont corrupt either tho
sussy...
i really need to fix takeoff
but attachments scuffed and
honestly when addon api comes out
entirety of takeoff getting redone anyways
UMG blocking latest clockwork post
:coppercrying:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INw7lDciv6Y
funny create addon
soon
tm
With Clockwork, you can use schematics on ships
And you have clockwork
Oh really? Nice
But yeah build out to the corners of the ship‚Äôs bounding box and select them
Then you can save your ship
im supposed to be in a zoom meeting for my job rn but
they arent letting me in
so
LMFAO
soon
very soon
speaking of soon
:3drevenge:
its been 17 minutes
its almost like making a super heavyweight aircraft with propellor propulsion is
unwise
:Thonk:
i really need to add afterblazers
but im siiickk
jesus christ

aeo is technically more and less complex
aero*
it has no way to directly or indirectly control with wasd
clockwork provides options for that
like the flap bearing and command seat
which is probably why aero planes are slow because i doubt youd be able to control them otherwise
correc
we're waiting for fluid sims ‚ú®
eventually
yes
i fear
truly
not rn tho because disassembly is soos
perhaps
20k
damn
back in my day vw had cannons too
nah
it never was
the idea of using aero came up but it was never explicitly an aero addon
its a vs2 addon now technically
so
it uses VSBodies for its mech parts
everythin gonna be simulated
ye
mekapi is
its engine
R&D just has its own server

titanfall
oh my god
war update
it all makes sense now
why not
you dont do things because it seems pointless, you do it because you feel like it
also some aero blocks don't exist in vs and vice versa
what if someone wanted to use aero's optical sensors with clockwork's sequenced seat
plus there are quite a few create addons planning to use aero
like Steam n Rails
and making them incompatible seems
mid
üíÄ
ehhhh
youd be devving twice
itd be like fabric and forge all over again
and thats cringe
just cause create and mekanism do the same things dont mean i dont want both
tazer is an aero dev copper
tracky moment
fair
but you're still in the vicinity
nah ryan said specifically that it wouldnt be compatible
i know its not made entirely by ryan but those were his words
they load fine tho
ruby got them working
lmfao
ah then damn
well vs2 has its own system
doesn't need tracky
im pretty sure he meant totally incompatible
as he was talking about better portals when he was saying that
even if they have zero cross functionality
not letting them boot is lame
he's definitely checked the vs2 code before so im sure he knows whether or not
craftmine real
forcing incompat is against cf tos yea
they didnt have 24k people when they went closed
clockwork logo real
not clickbait
You were mentioning devs watching :clueless:
NOO
THE CONNECTION BUG
THE WINGS
LMFAOOO
genius logo tactic
NO
THE SEATS
FUCK
WE FIXED THAT ALREADY
THE HELL
for the stream only
LMFAO
STICKY KEYS
PFFT
for the stream
gotta have it
:clueless:
soon
‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
nah im not releasing today
the version shalz is using is out of date but like
https://tenor.com/view/here-it-comes-tornado-meme-gif-23054073
enough ca, today, we cockwork
Man's server crashed agian
üíÄ
id let him if he wanted smh
i gotta crank out the clockwork faster
so that people can get this
bro my throat is aching rn im sick as shit and i was yelling at the monitor every time his ship was unbalanced
üíÄ
i was only ten days after you on my og account :clueless:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxwqKMESj6M
we're streamin it now
:clueless:
we crashed
the game
:clueless:
do you have kotlin for forge
:clueless:
because wings work on contraptions
also because our wings have two different types-
if they were sails, youd have issues with windmills providing infinite thrust
old one has some charm because it was 3d imo
i like the new one a lot
but it's a lot flatter
thats nott he same an9imation what
afterblazer moment
its not animated because blockbench refuses to
let me use animated textures in a gif
i know how animated textures work
blockbench just dislikes them
afterblazer :clueless:
that's VS: Tournament
its a beyblade-esque addon
it's the Stratodonut
it sets an afterblazer into its "Above Y=320" state permanently
aka
NYOOOOM
yes
because above y320 you dont need to wait for chunk loading
hence the afterblazer's purpose
its meant for high altitude fast flight
high speed travel
but also fighter jets
thats a vs2 thing
:stratodonut:
its for the afterblazer specifically
it makes it act as if it were above y=320
because creative blaze cake sets it to supercharged state
but the "INFURIATED" state of above y=320 is actually
above supercharged's "FUMING"
incorrect
it actually uses liquid fuel
this is the only item you can use on it
well yeah but the way it works is diff
yes
its a jet engine
might even need intakes
:clueless:
not directly connected mind you
just somewhere on the ship
üíÄ
nah essentially
im gonna check the ship for attachments
and if the ship has no intakes
no thrust
id imagine you may still want these engines considering propellors fall off rather quickly
propellors don't work above ~y=240
nah fuming is vanilla create's supercharged name internally
infuriated would be above y=320
i am but a single man
ive made all this stuff in 3 weeks
ill get there when i get there
:clueless:
oh yeah fair
dw we have some fun stuff planned for massive airships
like scalable hot air burners :clueless:
because why have a bunch of tiny shitty 1 block burners when you can have like 2 5x5x5 massive ones that actually look cool
actually we were gonna have an inverse of the combustion engine, our tiny engine, and have a "massive" alternative
for truly large airships
that need truly ludicrous SU
you underestimate the sheer cost of propellors
1.18.2 but 1.19.2 port when vs2 updates
rapidly fluctuating?
who do you think i am
nah thats just cause the drone was using scuffed props
you think i code and dont make sure things are stable smh
wait they dont work there?
guh
cables work fine on vs2
someone actually wanted to make an immersive engineering addon
i mean hell
vs1 had
wires as its main control method
lmfao
actually 1.12 vs1 was probably the least mod-conflict ship mod to ever exist
which is
kinda sad
but its true
smh my head
anyways
:stratodonut:
new emoji gang
oh also
unlike the blaze cake
you can eat a stratodonut
its kinda like a golden apple, but it gives you mobility effects
thanks to @Copper for the idea :clueless:
yes
plus slowfall
nah its wholly beneficial
its not like the blazecake
could make you leave a trail of fire tho
:clueless:
true
you're not you when you're hungyr
afterblazers will probably use the same fuel as combustion engines
but maybe i can make them have mod compat fuels as well
my guy its a liquid
ü§®
they should work for liquids but
uhh
this mod is forge + fabric
so id have to find a fabric alternative for that side
its a stratodonut
wdym
blaze nommin
maybe ill make that
there is
but when disasembling
it only takes back the things that are glued
so you may want to expand your glue
hold on im
any% speedrunning afterblazers in general rn
ive already got them 50% done
:clueless:
honeslty i could
throw that together in a second
watch this

APNG for the win
who needs nitro boosting
blockbench actually added an APNG export
and it is beautiful
the physics lightning
its kinda clockwork's motif
lmfao
nah bro they start like
:LETSFUCKINGGOOOO:
LMFAO
this is part of the Afterblazer block
#clockwork-üïö
its an afterburner jet lol
bit
blaze

that
is actually an incredible idea
im stealing that
ü§®
its an exhaust you weirdo
set anything behind you on fire
torch shit
:clueless:
a sonic boom is absolutely something id want to do
it gets closer every day
the combustion engine is the mini engine for ships
it runs off liquid fuel
the large scalable engines arent revealed yet
üòâ
there'd just be one intake type
because it'd be easier that way
lmfao
:Thonk: their details are still kinda bein worked out so id wait a bit and see
wont answer anythijng about them yet as
they're update 0.1.5
not first release
then it was 630
now its 7
yes
when the clock strikes twelve
id say though
shit gon get fun
#clockwork-üïö
its at 7
they push them
it doesnt move at linear speed
that would be based
correct
clockwork will release with total create compat
yeah
c# :diesofdeath:
java is way easier its just a bitch
:stratodonut:
feed it a stratodonut
go faster
ooh wait i need to add the Stratodonut as a potato cannon ammunition type
what should its effect be
:Thonk:
wait
perfect
high projectile velocity
because when you use it as a weapon you probably dont want to give your enemy anything positive
ye
it was a stream
yes
there's only like 2 that arent private so ye
lol
clockwork will handle physics trains itself since
steam n rails uses simulated
wont be compat
as per their decision not ours
but that discussion ended hours ago lmao
you can scroll up and read it if youd like
unfortunately my afterblazer speedrunning will not probably be completed tonight
but im like
70% done with it
fashion
i made it render silly on the head
my priorities are definitely in order
:clueless:
cause its a block
you can wear any item
:Thonk:
wings do have a falloff...
Mysda
Actually we were gonna let Mysda in lmfao
I forgor
üíÄ
we have a lot
Vallen, Kwizzle, Rango, Shalz
I mean admittedly
It did crash shalz‚Äôs server thrice?
Nah that was just from something sus
I‚Äôm dad
At the soup store
We need to get a bunch of creators on at once to do something stupid
Woow
So the 5 year old devs a mod in 3 weeks
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs one hell of a 5 year old
I‚Äôm just insulted because he clearly doesn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm 3
I would never
I don‚Äôt I just kinda vibe
They dislike me but they have no ammunition to ban me
There‚Äôs forge and fabric
Fabric is a little sussy rn tho
Cause in our porting to forge
We had to cut some corners
Icarus üíÄ
Once I finish the afterblazer, intakes, reactionwheels
I‚Äôm gonna add hot air balloons
R&D already has one
It‚Äôs cathartic
Mentally yes
that‚Äôs kinda half of it
It‚Äôs not scope creep if I code it all in a day anyways
DID SOMEHODY SAY MECHS
I remember commenting on those videos a ton ages ago
Back when fan engines worked
you used to be able to heat a fan to produce power
However on the other side of the create mech spectrum

you got me
Then I‚Äôll use it to make mekapi
oh btw you should not make circular props
They need to be balanced
If they aren‚Äôt, you will

Grab blocks
And let go
Lod is lod
Correct
ü¶ó
ooooh noo! The scary 1984
guess you gotta be banished to the shadow realm, jimbo
Wonder why lol
But it still fits into it
Eureka is 100% a word that would fit into a philosopher‚Äôs vocabulary
My transporters
it‚Äôs actually a mispelling of ptato
LMAO
actually since we have clockwork emojis
Tetanus

:slurp:
:slurp:
so we got
I should add the
Those would be good emojis
And a spinning turtle from VC
Cannons
Make it sea of thieves
Use the cannon carriage
On the deck
Cannon carriage you can move
Valkyrien Computing
No I mean that‚Äôs in cbc
It exists already
It‚Äôs called the cannon carriage
Intake very simple
Place anywhere on ship
Jets won‚Äôt really work very well when they aren‚Äôt already at speed so the intake allows that to make more sense
:E_sleepdeprived: on it boss LMAO
the real question
what do i name the intake to be a pun
no
lmfao
ü§®
ill call it uhhh
you mean as paddleboat wheels?
we have a seperate thing for paddleboats
would be scuffed as engine is liquid fueled already
i think ill just have it require rpm power
as it turns out making a create style intake is hard :clueless:
wow
that pun
hold on lemme put it with the afterblazer
for comparison
incorrect
the connection point actually transitions to the blazer's color palette

typically you wouldnt have them connected like this tho cause being able to fuel your jet is kinda important
:clueless:
and the fuel input for the afterblazer is on its end
there's 3 variants
did i post them all
nah its the intake
but air aint its fuel
would look worse on model, i tried
:3drevenge:
smh
i will refrain from making the easy joke
for tears
youll see ‚ú®
he says to the voices in his head
it doesnt really
the afterblazer is designed for high altitude flight
as flying above height limit makes you not need to load chunks
therefore
im a dev on too much
logic be damned its got a blaze that likes donuts powering it
rest is for cowards
:3drevenge:
and also i am resting
by coding
its relaxing
me enjoy working on mod
me not stressed
back on the grindset

?
im having a ton of fun lmao
plus i cant do anything else
im sick
cant even talk
voice gone
eureka tends to dislike clockwork personally
but i think we fixed that
incorrect
every time someone asks i speed up a second faster
:Gun_But_Better:
every time i look at my texture for the stratodonut
it makes me hungry
:stratodonut:
this aint a race
its a time trial
:clueless:
me racing my ghost in intellij cart 8 to try and beat my time
my family is waiting
üîî i think its been like
2 months
:clueless:
i dont really care LMFAO
whats wrong
i am an it clearly
coding potato battery
troll
:trol:
rip
nah i know im meming lmfao
lets be real
no its dumb/ass
https://tenor.com/view/eating-magnets-gif-19614987
alright time to go speedrun finishing (mostly) afterblazers
and the intake
i wont be able to fully finish them as
no fuel yet
but ill make them work
also fuel is gonna be a bitch
because forge and fabric
no fluid capability on architectury
:noelele:
im gonna have to make them work different on fabric and forge
forge create uses forge fluid capability
fabric create uses its own
ill just use lasagna lib /j
one of takeoff's coremods
yeah essentially i just gotta code like
a base for the burner on archi
then extend it on forge and fabric
for the fuel
but its fine cause fuel later anyways
yes
i really dont wanna make the processing machine's model
maybe ill make dust slave away at it
both modloaders or bust
thats the motto
the intake is what takes rpm
the jet just uses fuel because its a blaze
its essentially living
you're just feeding the blaze air and food and it does the work
:clueless:
like a blaze burner
again im limited by input slots
unfortunately
create limitations and im NOT making my own create block type
because
boilerplate hell
üíÄ
probably quite a bit when at low speed but
itll power itself at high
essentially you're only powering it at low speed because it has to pull in air itself
but when at high speed
you're already ramming air in there
itll probably flameout
someone suggested a sonic boom when you pass the normal speed limit above y=320
and i thought that would be sick
we dont question it
well propellors dont have a super high speed limit because chunkloading limitations
but when above y=320
you dont need to load chunks
so just
hence the whole concept of the engine
its for going real fast in a place you can
propellors dont even really work up there
they drop off to 5% at y=320 and they're near unusable at around 240 somethin
propellors bel ike
ironic that you use something from the nether to do it then
:clueless:
wonder if that was intentional
or something
you dont need to wait for chunks to load when you're above the height limit
thats the point
they'll still have a speed limit obv but
much higher than props
?
props ahve a speed limit
its balanced around chunkloading
not limited directly by it
props cant travel faster than their exhaust velocity
well that second one only with c2me
and no c2me support yet
üòî
when valkyrien c2me multiloader edition
itll just sound like
BWOOOSH
idk how ill get that sound effect
should i make it like with the infuser
i made those sfx
problemwith that lojay
i dont have a voice rn
LMFAO
config
all configurable
like eureka
and ill use create's config system for style points since im forced to anyways
:clueless:
eehhh a little higher
because the prop speed limit isnt actually super fast
especially since a gigantic mega propellor will need a gigantic mega ship to power it
its about
i think 100 b/s? maybe a little higher or lower?
i havent done a test to find out actually
not super duper far off
since every block is a meter
that was a low estimate i have no idea tbh
:clueless:
the math is very complex
triode helped me
it also accounts for balanced propellors obv
and soon propellor conservation of momentum so you can make helicopters that actually work like helis
aka
use tailfin prop to cancel out
stabilize for free
:clueless:
well since jets dont have to care about chunkloading their speed limit probably wouldnt be too much different
but flying below 320
yeah
we'll need to make like a speed slider
i know for a fact you're installing c2me and maxing that out
:clueless:
LMFAO
config wont be on release 1 btw
since no c2me
itll probably come with 0.1.5 or 0.2
0.2 is gonna be fun
planning suspension and stuff
vsbodies required tho so its a bit off
0.1 is planes and light blimps
and then we'll uh
figure it out from there
we're doing it create style
so we'll have
0.1a
0.1b
etc
guh
its a midversion
like 0.3.2
i have an i9 10850k
would that be good enough to test
ill give it a roll then
what were your testing parameters anyways
like how did you
test
3 weeks and we keep on truckin
btw the afterblazer uses analog redstone signal for throttle now
15 is 100% and 0 is 0%
well cause you can control the propellor with like
rotation power
but the engines need something since they dont take rpm
funny little note
i am going insane
lmfao
ü§®
already is in to a degree
if your propellor isnt balanced
it produces a lot of torque
but we're planning to have actual prop torque for helicopters
just requires more number tuning
who needs gyroscopes for helis when you can simply take advantage of existing torque :clueless:
soon
yes you can prop fly
source gaming moment
vs2 stuff but create
we don't really have an end goal
our endgame is whenever the idea well runs out
üòÖ
which wont be for a while
we've probably got about 5 major versions worth
release version 0.1 will have everything for planes and light aircraft/blimps
0.1.5 will have stuff for heavy aircraft and giant airships
0.2 is gonna be land and water equipment
then we'll figure it out from there
thats a long ass time awya so
no idea lmao
create aint even on 1.0
its on 0.5
i somehow killed the afterblazer's blaze üòü
it aint rendering
uhoh
it may be because i added a booleanproperty for powered
under a month
no they will fly on sheer hopes and dreams /j
in all seriousness
afterblazer takes liquid fuel (and requires that an intake be on the ship)
propellor takes RPM and a lot of SU
thats just putting me at the driver's seat
speen like washing machine
windmills don't have enough power to propel themselves lmfao
that'd be violating thermodynamics
and also be kinda lame
true but windmills still lame
combustion engines, which also use liquid fuel
for the small ships
and then for massive stuff we have something planned but thats a spoiler for the next version
:clueless:
goofy ah plane
cant be any worse than R&D's windup walker
the andesite meka
wind it like a windup toy
:diesofdeath:
clockwork vsified contraptions will also work
and technically also be cc controllable
since create cc integration exists
i have harnessed
the harness
afterblazer still fighting me rendering wise
:MENACING:
just spent two hours trying to solve an issue
and
it was a string
i may be a fast coder
but i am anything but a smart one

its actually this
lmfao
it was a create addon for a day during shalz's stream
i think the old 3d one still has a lot of charm tbh
but the new one is artistically better
they're an extra block long
however
that second block has no voxelshape
so you can walk through it or place through it
its just visual
itll get somewhat easier to do cool stuff once im done with reactionwheels and other util blocks
for the most part we've only got essential ones
not publicly :clueless:
i should make a public roadmap tbh
i only work when i have a deadline
:clueless:
i happen to have a deadline
minor issue ive realized
i have no way to allow afterblazers to gimbal
and a jet engine without gimbal is
ü§®
technically youd be able to use a contraption for gimbaling anyways so
:clueless:
ill just add a gimbal bearing or some bullshit
actually
triode had genius idea
better than no gimbal
are you accidentally cutting power to the flap bearing
when their power is cut they reset
cannon carriages shouldnt be supported so its a wonder they work at all :clueless:
clockwork fixes what they rely on
incredible
ah yeah happens
my math is impeccable as always
there is just
so much
>plume offset wrong
intentional
this deserves to go in cursed vs2 images volume 2 rango
when you inevitably make that video
im so confused as to why its doing what its doing
:susie:

there you go
spin
ROW ROW FIGHT THE POW-
afterblazers are about
i know i said that yesterday
but i was actually thinking of half of the half
they aren't even really that complex im just stupid rn cause sick
:E_sleepdeprived:
it is now lmfao
i can do many things
math
is not one
because triode is busy and so is ewou
and dust
i think ruby is too
not sure tho tbh
you dont need krunch
you got kotlin for forge?
:Thonk: what mods
orion drive moment
the kraken
Reaction wheel would make that 12x easier
As will prop conservation of momentum
Especially not for controlling things on physics tick
It is 3am
I cannot sleep
How Do you do gamers
Yeah cgm guns are op
Potato cannon only based gun
:clueless:
You guys do realize that
Shrapnel shot AND sniper shot are both possible in the potato cannon
Berries for shrapnel
Carrot for sniper
Takeoff isn‚Äôt meant to be what it is rn

LIFE
IT RETURNS TO ME
Nope still feel like shit but I got to sleep in at least
Perhaps not to the server but
I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve helped with clockwork lmao
I‚Äôm sure someone else would‚Äôve taken up my mantle had I not worked on it
There are a lot of passionate people in this server
Is that a challenge

Copper will kill you anyways
let‚Äôs be real
Skybound
It‚Äôs not super active rn
It won‚Äôt just be small things
That‚Äôs just the first update
Update 0.1.5 will be massive crafts
We‚Äôve already said this lol
Project red 1.18 when
Or does it exist already idk
I want vsified trains so I can recreate renai transportation
Null knows what renai is
I‚Äôm pretty sure
I want trains to leap majestically
Like in factorio
honestly vsified trains are probably
Behind bearings
Bearing > trains > everything else
I‚Äôd love to but I just got up
Lemme go wake up first
:diesofdeath:
It would :clueless:
yeah
They just aren‚Äôt powerful enough to propel themselves with a prop
There‚Äôs no reason to restrict them
Nahh
Disabling them is pointless
Propellors take more su than they produce to lift them
That‚Äôs the balance
They can‚Äôt self propel
No but the windmill bearing does
:clueless:
Also that‚Äôs subject to change
It‚Äôs actually easy
You can get all of the blocks in a contraption already
Triode will just have to make krunch recognize the blocks in a contraption and their angle
then bet
I gotta add clockwork weights anyways
I think imma take today off of new feature grind and focus on some polish for a sec
:Thonk:
Fuck gradle
clockwork will simply keep adding layers to itself as it progresses
i have a few fun ideas for post 0.2
but nothing solid yet
potato cannon prepped
there's a laundry list
that means a lot
ive got far better planned once vsbodies are ready
:clueless:
my voice is usually pretty average in pitch but im sick rn so it sounds like a dying horse eating a cactus
:clueless:
you think that can stop me
a water gun
well yeah
they're still physics objecs
the vsbodies
the only difference is they arent blocks
bro im assembling a fabric create pack for
and im realizing just how few create addons exist for fabric
its literally just
deco
and cc&a
waiting for vsbodies
clockwork and R&D will change that :clueless:
yeah but
some of these addons are mcreator tier
or literally mcreator
how is broken bad not ported its like 5 items and some json ü§®
:diesofdeath:
gamers
what would be some good shaders to fly around with
:clueless:
i mean i agree i dislike fabric but it is faster in a lot of instances and also i have to dev for fabric to dev for architectury anyways
ya know what
im gonna do something stupid
1.19.2 ü§®
it shouldnt matter mc version right
```To install this shaderpack, you need to have minecraft 1.19.2 and a shader loader (either Iris (recommended) or OptiFine). Please do not report bugs that occur when running the shaderpack on testing versions of either shader loader.```
mfw no oculus mention
ü§®
too much c*ock leakin
ü§®
what is ipbr
i never use shaders
:clueless:
send
:clueless:
i think i can handle
ohhh
maybe its in that rethinking voxels thing too
:Thonk:
how about you
https://tenor.com/view/try-it-and-see-give-it-a-try-try-try-and-see-try-it-yourself-gif-24095805
fabric for that performance
cant use cbc
id port cbc to fabric but i dont think im technically allowed to without permission
and ritchie wont answer my dms
:clueless:
rubidium is nice but real sodium better
c2me best
i am trying to counter this but
galacticraft
galacticraft got ported by alpha
:clueless:
still counts
should i also use a texturepack perhaps
hmm
unsure

HE SHOUTS OUT RANGO
@Rango
our homegrown youtuber got a direct shoutout in a shalz vidoe
:clueless:
üòî
i dont know what they're talking about
because half the textures are literally reusing create assets
LMFAO
the flap bearing and propellor bearing namely
its aeronautics stans
ü§®
my friend

do not forget who i am
:trol:
the vr mech is just blocks tied to a viewmodel
why do people always say this
cbc works with vs2 already
just use the nightly build
mekapi gonna be :armold_schwarzenegger:
thats gonna need vsified contraptions
wheels will come when vsbodies
clockwork doesn't have survival stuff yet
thatll come with the polish wave
before first release
holy shit i just hopped onto a world with them voxel shaders
ive got 100 fps with settings cranked
ye
the
whatchamacalit
update 2
im right here
also no i accept all messages
it just have requests on
using it on 1.18 rn
unfortunately the version of create clockwork depends on is actually not on cf and got skipped on the maven
so i have to use alex skin
pensive
dev environment gaming üòî
i mean it isnt listed on the maven
for some reason
the version we depend on
fabric
it went from 0.5.0c to 0.5.0g-832
we use 0.5.0g-827 or something
this voxelshader doesn't like vs2 :(
shadows are fucked with ships
damn
imma try
ez claps
its heated / superheated / supersonic
because im reusing the create temperature states
technically in the code it goes
and then i added
"infuriated"
which is purplb
prblbpbl
clockwork will be soon :clueless:
big brain
^
the joke died a month ago
"ohohohogoodob oog ab ooga look i made a picture of a neanderthal with average Aero fan/Vs2 fan"
so original

clockwork devs
yes LMFAO
its a cropped version of that fuckin video of a tf2 dev adding snakes to cp_snakewater
:clueless:
copper hasnt done any devving
other than a few hours of gravitron tweaking
its mostly me, ewou, and fluffy
and dust
cant forget gravitroni man
today is break day for me on new features so i can work on other polished stuff
almost like im the one making them or smthn
for an answer
:clueless:
and making a plane and recording a silly video with shaders
:clueless:
idiot
ruby already has them
triode created a rube goldberg machine to send a 500 ton steel weight to crush them if i ever drop the pace
:trol:
i dont
know how tbh
LMFAO
like a trello?>
triode helps with most of my math stuff
cause i suck at math
question does anyone know a good like
dev flowchart website i could use
i wouldnt mind making a roadmap but
trello bad
:diesofdeath:
well i dont want a literal
progress board like trello or alternatives
i want a like
correct
i may use a trello for now tho
ü§®
explain pls
oh wait
i see
:Thonk: how setup
ill do it
oh wait
roadmaps private beta
:diesofdeath:
so myself
jack of all trades master of none
oi don't doubt my artistic ability
im making the clockwork logo already
Soon tho
I don‚Äôt do leaks even to friends
Only r&d dev even who has access is somedom
And that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs on the team
Lmfao
Yes obviously
Mike is clearly one in a line of clones I produced to replace my failing organs after spending 200 hours straight on clockwork
ü§®
That was hilarious
I underwent mitosis
Now everyone in the r&d discord is my clone
I don‚Äôt code fast I simply have 70 alternative accounts all working at once like a hivemind
COLLECTIVE CONCIOUSNESS CONTROLLED AS YOUUU WILL SEEEEE
How have you managed to have a ship with a mass of zero
that actually happens with eureka a bit
You can also still gain free vertical power and speed by holding s and d
And it hasn‚Äôt been fixed since 1.16
Who needs balloons
Wooden platform with s + d flies better
You can prop fly with the gravitron
That is sufficient trolling
it can
it infact
already has
before
pojav
someone did it
it was @Andrupka
the voxel thing is sus with its shadows
it only needs kotlin for forge and vs2
and if fabric
literally just
vs2
what video
ü§®
thats just flat out wrong
what did you even download
wait that got discontinued?
that's not even super hard to do
ponders are just schematics
the Idiot is getting an upgrade
i was originally making a new plane
but it looks like shite
so
idiot time
today was supposed to be a chill day where i record some funny plane clips and instead it has been a sisyphean struggle
to just
fly straight
LMFAO

easy
like
very easy
its a single line lol
calculateStressImpact() {
havent tested but magma suck
use arclight
considering i can get that as a variable at any point
yes
krunch actually isnt mc related
its just an engine
you  could theoretically port vscore to whatever game you want
vscore has zero relation to mc either
only vs2
has mc code
replay actually works perfectly fine with vs2
replay just doesnt work in general :3drevenge:
they butchered the controls from the 1.12 era
wtf did they do to it
it used to be so easy
now its taken me like 2 hours to position a camera and not accidentally speed up the video
üíÄ
cannons work on ships
just use nightly version
then you're good
the build with autocannons works fine
on their discord
its like a beta build
ye
cbc works very well on vs ships
even works on scaled down vs ships
though the smoke doesnt scale down so you may not be able to see LMFAO
i am upset
replaymod has ruined my day smh my head
a video i have now been forced to cancel because replaymod recorded the plane moving once every
10 seconds
:clueless:
mfw lag
since i dont know if ill ever finish this in its current state
have the starter part of it i managed to make before replaymod shat the bed
(uploading)

the clockwork slave labor desk
after using fabric's replaymod
i have to agree
that was torture
both
it didnt record on physics tick
so planes look like they're moving at
4fps
you can see it in the shadow
at the end there
nah im just gonna have to force someone to be my cameraman
no im hijacking dust's schedule
lmfao
actually
it getting distorted makes sense
isnt that the doppler effect
ahh
üíÄ
Landlord is the rendering engine
guh
I really need to make the clockwork logo
But I wanted to make an animation
Simply check the config
You can also change what it won‚Äôt let you assemble
Main menu > mods > click eureka> click config
Grass is just on the blacklist so you dont accidentally assemble a continent
I miss the ascii art one
:(
The binary thing is cool but it‚Äôs too smooth to fit with the heavy aliasing on the V
Clockwork high seas pirate rp when
takeoff, tournament, clockwork, stardust
also VC
tournament is for beyblade tournaments (and adapting what takeoff is now into a permanent state)
valkyrien computers is cc integation
a spinning toy that youd make ram into other spinning toys to see which stops spinning first
^^^
LMFAO
man
are beyblades really that old?

Just make sure you‚Äôre using create 0.5.0g and the latest GitHub vs2
boutta
just finished something fun
7:30 is not backwards from 7
ü§®
it's an infuser version of the vs2 logo :clueless:
üï¢
yes
it is
lol
you dont know how to read an analog clock do you
the small hand is the hour hand
the large hand is the minute hand
bro
you dont know how to read an analog clock
üíÄ
literally click on the emoji

:salutebz:
aseprite
side by side comparison btw
cause main vs logo is pixel style
:trol:
i mean
i could make you a proper VC logo
:clueless:
you know you can skip it right
i think shalz accidentally does at least once lmfao
:Thonk:
dm me your idea for it
ill give it a try
he tried
the ascii art didnt work
no he did it
it just doesnt work
lol
its too scuffed without a background
and with a background it doesnt look right
im talking to
axolotl
sequenced gearshifts have an option to "wait for next redstone signal"
valkyrien computing is like
every single computer mod integration
yes
content finished soon
then release of 0.1
i'd say content done by this week
ü§®
within 3 weeks id say
the afterblazer doesn't even have dictated values yet so idk how you're gonna say that lmfao
the title of the previous video is literally "good math"
its a meme lol
there is no reason
you can rotate the intake already
clockwork will have land features in its second update, mekapi will have land vehicles, valkyrien computers will let you control motors for wheels, etc
mekapi is gonna use vsbodies/generic physics objects to make vehciles
aka non-ships
like immersive vehicles but with physics
me myself and i
nah jk mekapi has a few people thatll help me but
it's not open rn or even really started since vsbodies are wip
clockwork is closed source
and also none of the land features are in it yet
or just
use valkyrien computers
#valkyrien-computers
i thought they worked now
ü§®
discord keeps failing to send messages and it is :diesofdeath:
ü§®
valkyrien computers has nothing to do with create
once vsbodies come we'll have wheel colliders
for now block wheels work
if wheel broke off
place new wheel
:clueless:
ü§®
vsbodies soon
probably
ruby's been working on them but they require
an entire rewrite essentially
since vs was designed for ships
and vsbodies are
in what universe
i mean you can make wheels out of cubes
if you
want to do that to yourself
well its trying to drive around on a cube lol
you'd go up and down
not exactly a smooth ride
you can make anything you set your head to really
someone made a quadcopter drone with just #takeoff
that's scuffed is why
üß† üí•
brain damage
:salutebz:
so true
well yeah because tournament is literally "takeoff's alpha state if it were a full mod"
takeoff wont have any of its current features when its done
for now yes
but farters still funnier
:clueless:
:salutebz:
its all visual
it is a very fancy shader
with very few non-visual aspects
yeah no the Physics Mod doesnt have that
thats all visual
it also just kinda magics waves into existence
also its name is very confusing
cause it makes any mod that adds physics (like vs2) hard to talk about in the same sentence as it lol
not sealed spaces
when it implements fluid simulations
:trol:
essentially
with a funny low res fluid sim
if you have a bowl
open top
place it in water and it floats
does water go into it
but if you use sealed rooms, it would
with a fluid sim, you could occlude water based on the actual shape of it
rather than just le sealed room

like this
opposite
sealed rooms get more performance heavy
the larger the room
i think he's asking how we're planning simulating water made of 1m^3 cubes of water
lol
no i know mike is trolling
im saying lad
analog input
if more redstahone
if redstahone less
burner burn less
no redstone no burn
its not super precise but we work with what we've got
alternatively i could tie it into rpm
that'd give you 256 different states
rather than 15
thats not
how burners work
not every ship weighs the same
the freezer
fuck you, i turned my balloon into ice and am now plummeting out of the sky
:clueless:
same as a blaze burner
just no blaze
aw hell naw me when n o blaze in my blaze burne
average create addon moment
100%
how to set clock back by 3 hours
how about a sped up video we call realtime
this is legally not a joke
locked dlc
smh
:trol:
me when the first comment on every clockwork video is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for aeronautics‚Äù
:clueless:
Correct
They may have the army
And IntelliJ installed
*slowly turns to archimedes ships*
It‚Äôs a concept as old as dirt
They do
>claims eureka is shit
also vs2 doesn‚Äôt use entities
Wait a second
Hold on
:diesofdeath:
But we have belts
Or will when lod
And better than their impl
Since we‚Äôll use surface velocity
He was trolling
^^^
Aero‚Äôs server constantly treats eureka like vs2
That will change though
Especially since the flight of the idiot is nearing 20k views
:clueless:
Bigbrain plane
I still need to make that next video
Belts with a surface velocity means they can also move ships that are on top of them and don‚Äôt need to be fully on the block to provide force
Like you could make a conveyor belt of ships
Or drag yourself up out of a ditch
Also Vs2‚Äôs engine is not Java limited
option 6
Or option 7 mekapi :trol:
Which means mekapi
We can‚Äôt know for certain
Since aero is closed source
But landlord sure does *resemble* vs2 code
:trol:
also aero ships are entities iirc
You wonder why aero planes move at 5 miles per hour
Literally right click + `refactor‚Ä¶`
I sure do love their video of an end island in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù with the island flipping at a constant rate on a perfect axis and then coming to an abrupt stop
They‚Äôre voodoo magic
And the video after one of the devs posted in general of them walking on the tipped island with no walking animation and doubled sounds on block break
And frame stuttering
But guys the f3 menu says 70fps so even though you can see the graph red lines jumping it‚Äôs gotta be smooth
Or if it wasn‚Äôt threaded
Or didn‚Äôt use udp
Gotcha
I can do that
Eating dinner rn
I got to experience it firsthand with replaymod installed
For some reason it seems to make ship movement stutter as if it was on gametick
So
I would teleport constantly
Lmfao
Ah yes another member of the hive
I will
Watch me
Wait a minute
Did they
Look at the tail
It has no bearing top

Kekw
I mean clearly if it‚Äôs good enough for ticks it‚Äôs good enough for frames /j

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1059571325741568000/1067547047818952755/ClockworkLarge.png
Got it covered
Forces aren‚Äôt based on ship scale but create contraptions do work
Actually no compression banding
That is intentional
1/7th
well they have seven members right
So theoretical;y
You could claim 1/7th
When krunch respects actual block shapes

It‚Äôs a 200x200 pixel image (when not upscaled_
I‚Äôm not working with infinite space
ü§®
My guy that‚Äôs the sky
The v is in the sky
The source of light is the sun
Which is above it
Hence why it is shaded on the far edges and bottom and light on the near edges, top, and center
Mic will never be appeased
It‚Äôs a logo :clueless:
The main vs logo has it as well
Well admittedly it‚Äôs more in front of it
The main vs logo has no brass
No
It‚Äôs nondescript yellow metal
I think gold
Yeah
Brass is the clockwork logo
Because brass is dull

There‚Äôs a lot of hue shifting
More orange/red on the darker tones
More yellow on the lighter
I don‚Äôt do light and dark
White highlights wouldn‚Äôt look quite right on the whole darker vibe of this I feel
Especially not at the base
Even the main yellow looks bright down there
Ehh
Brass isn‚Äôt a bright metal
Brass is dull typically
Think of a drum cymbal
They are rarely shiny
It‚Äôs meant to work as the materials it‚Äôs made out of
Since the V is very clearly the infuser
It uses the infuser‚Äôs color palette
(A little expanded though)

originally the clockwork logo was gonna have a massive gear
but
it was waaaay too noisy
it made the thing impossible to recognize when small
does that say SMP
the V may not be my best work
however
i do have something that is my best work
rango you know what im about to post

animating this thing is like filing taxes
actually
they made blockbench animating 12x better
finally added bezier curves

it was using geckolib

it has piss shit range

hold on lemme do that now actually
literally one number

honestly the sheer variety of addons we've got is insane imo
already
and we havent even had an addon community for very long
well
no
eureka

existed?
but like new addons have been cropping up rapidly recently
cant wait to roll up in my biomechanical amalgamation R&D ship to airdrop mechs on people
me when addons
i dont even need to elaborate on why stardust is cool
just
its evident
so true
actually
maybe i can work on R&D's living ship mechanics while i wait for vsbodies

after clockwork tho
me when i have to build a massive stomach and organs for my ship to keep it alive
aint no point without no range

someone suggested an "exposed infuser" that would infuse stuff in front of it but not itself
*vwoosh*

glue cares for no man
alright thats it
2 days is enough break for me
ive gotta get back on the grindset
the mindset even
ignore the fact that my idea of a break has been making more assets for clockwork
deployer already works with it
its just an on-right-click thing
the automatic plane factory thing will be easy too once lod
since belts can have surface velocity
so you can push ships on them
literally just a ship belt
hmm
so you can make sure the ship has passed a certain point before building the next
ropes wouldnt be hard
:bz_true:
yeah just shutdown intellij and reopen
you mean tetrode
or pentode
perfect rigid constraints are something triode was working on
nono not perfect rigid as in like no compliance
i mean perfect rigid as perfect stable
rn constraints are not perfectly stable
even if their compliance is 0
they will still wobble
use valkyrien computers
they have a radar
but i mean i guess i could
Well a radar is an electrical system
Fuck it, sonar guided missile /j
Beginning?
People have made besiege jokes since the start
Use create kaboom then
They wanted to maybe use vs2
For their bombs and missiles and icbms
Yeah
Actually they may be waiting for clockwork
Cause compat
Why do you think besiege machines are as stable as a twig
how do you manage
Is your plane made out of hopes and dreams
Made to be crushed
I mean if they pick clockwork at least they‚Äôll get to start deving before the hype dies out
As the person making clockwork
I disagree
But to each their own
Also clockwork‚Äôs polish is half the reason it isn‚Äôt out yet
The first release‚Äôs features are about 80% done
Maybe a little higher
polish is just gonna take a while
Extensive bug testing
cope
within 3 weeks
:clueless:
yeah it looks like it to me
:diesofdeath:
Your top comment on your latest video is ‚Äúis this create aeronautics‚Äù
When the video title has
‚ÄúValkyrien Skies‚Äù
I just gotta keep uploading
The algorithm loves my trend hopping
Take a shot
you‚Äôd be dead in 5 minutes
I am quite the speed runner after all
Ewou no
Do I add anyone who says aero repeatedly to the list of mc uuids in clockwork that spawn with a jester suit attached
I mean I would never do such a thing
Of course
hypothetically
If I modeled an entire jester outfit
And tied it to uuids
How so
Spawning someone with free items doesn‚Äôt seem to be breaking tos
Even if those items are
User specific ban code is different
Exactly
My claim is my high explosive round
simply build a better wall
But it‚Äôs booringggg
Valkyrien clockwork steampunk/high seas/air pirate rp server when
For a true air pirate server we‚Äôd need #islands
Speedrun it like I speedrun clockwork
I will wait for you at the finish line
:guh
Guess I gotta finish clockwork‚Äôs content today

that‚Äôs it
We;re cranking this into maximum overdrive
GUH
Magnets are in #takeoff
They‚Äôre gonna get a major improvement soon
Potato battery
Rn they‚Äôre just a simple ‚Äúattract to eachother‚Äù but we have a fucking
Complex integral
We‚Äôve been trying to solve
For accurate magnetic fields
Wdym isn‚Äôt an option
ü§®
What becoming part
The GitHub packages are the official mod
Just download the one you need
ü§®
It‚Äôs the same thing
It‚Äôs just another download place
Bro just download the package
It‚Äôs not like you have to compile it
Never
:trol:
nah but actually idk
Then why care
krill issue
curseforge will let you
It‚Äôs magic
No, actually
A ship
Its own kind of object
No I don‚Äôt mean that sarcastically
It‚Äôs considered a ship
Like how a block is an object
And an entity is an object
A ship is an object
That‚Äôs why VSbodies are difficult to implement because it‚Äôs another ‚Äúit‚Äôs own thing‚Äù
Vsbodies being generic physics objects
Think of it like this
Entities are an object right
Ships are like entities in that they are also an object
Entities can be as simple as a painting or as complex as the ender dragon
Ships can be as simple as a block
Or as complex as a massive mech chained with constraints
You can‚Äôt in eureka but you can with takeoff
Takeoff bearings will detect if there‚Äôs a ship close enough
And latch onto it
Otherwise they spawn a new ship
A rope constraint already exists
A rope chain is just a bunch of constraints
Once vsbodies
It will be pathetically easy
Same with giving create contraptions collisions with the ground while on a ship
Vsbodies can just
Yeah
As far as I‚Äôm aware yes
But like
Vs bodies are so next level that my brain can‚Äôt really
Wrap my head around it lmfao
It‚Äôs an entire rewrite of vs2 technically since it‚Äôs making another type of ‚Äúthing‚Äù
Separate from ships
yeah obv
But they aren‚Äôt blocks
Or really like anything else in Minecraft ever
They‚Äôre literal physics bodies
They‚Äôre gonna take everything to the next level
along with lod
It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre so complex that they‚Äôre constantly dangled right out of our reach
Once vsbodies are done
To make mekapi
I must finish clockwork first
At least 0.1 of clockwork
I‚Äôm clockwork‚Äôs main dev
Not yet
But I finished afterblazer functionality
:clueless:
My list of things to finish left:
Reaction wheels
Intakes
Propulsion
And good luck
Go check out a few videos
Rn the main propulsion method is propellors
They aren‚Äôt
Not directly
You can use redstone to control flaps and use a redstone controller
Correct, or get smart about it
Can I just say
The command seat is the single most complex and useful block in clockwork rn
It takes a bit of learning
So
:trol:
Reaction wheels, intakes, balloon burners
Also technically I gotta do fuel processing and stuff but that‚Äôll come with the polish wave
Yeah
They also work on and off them
That‚Äôs just a bug
Vs2 main will have the fixes for create stuff in it
Once clockwork done
I know I‚Äôm missing something there
I can‚Äôt remember what
Nah
It‚Äôs content
Once content done I‚Äôm done
Won‚Äôt be in 0.1
nutium
alright its time for me to speedrun
for realsies
a bonafide speedrun
if i wanna win the race against ewou
aha im already in the lead
first commit of the day done cause i had stuff backed up
:trol:
üíÄ
working on burners rn btw
me when blimp
ü§®
what do you think clockwork is
you have your gradle project setup wrong
check settings.gradle
in your settings.gradle
you have your project name set as
vs-eureka-mod
dw we arent aero lmfao
"oh no someone dissed our mod"
anyways
clockwork has total create compat and it is fast approaching
yes
change that to whatever your project name is
you changed it at some point
nah is aight
dont worry about it
stop watching this brother
we must fight the MPLA
you changed it
idk
ten books
I will grind you down until the very SPARKS CRY FOR MERCY
thats in fact 10 bolded books
not ten books
try again

:trol:
clockwork is approaching being ready for 0.1
simple response

space addon api
as it turns out there are actually
4 different vs space addons
so we might as well make them all compatible
also it fits with mekapi so
it and mekapi are now being helmed by the same team
general api
so
I wish there was one that didn‚Äôt lag vs2 ships
:clueless:
I had to cancel my video project because of it
And because dust never got on to help
It makes vs2 ships stutter as if they were moving on gametick in 1.18
I live
Clockwork approaching at rapid pace
Oh shoot I forgot to move it
It‚Äôs 8 now
Balloon burners work as in you can insert fuel and control them with rpm
But
No balloon detection yet lol
Still gotta do that
Actually I think Ruby said he could
Nah block tag better
Not hard to implement
We won‚Äôt do the funny krunch air pocket detection in the first update since 0.1 balloons won‚Äôt be very large
Also cause it ain‚Äôt ready
Lol
0.1.5 balloons will be with the big scalable burner
0.1‚Äôs Ballooner is just a lil fella
Little guy
Blimps will get use out of it
:diesofdeath:
I think the one who asked is typing rn
I think you‚Äôd be pushing it‚Äôs limit but yeah
You ain‚Äôt :trol:
All addons are cross compatible
at least five
Five whole whams

THIS ONE
JUST FOR ME
First they take our c\* ock
Then they take our lives
Bro that‚Äôs 1984
It might be because someone turned on community
And discord auto enabled it
Aero claims they‚Äôve ‚Äútried to‚Äù
Unless you count spamming Ruby with friend requests on multiple accounts
Cause they see clockwork as a threat or smthn idk
I don‚Äôt care :clueless:
I make funny create ship mod
And I keep on keeping on
I don‚Äôt give a rats ass about their reputation or their opinion
Four now to be fair
Clearly
I mean obviously we stole from the closed source mod
:clueless:
I mean I think my propellor math is actually somewhat similar to theirs because I‚Äôm pretty sure their prop math was public for a while and when I was writing it it probably influenced my memory
So they could claim
Thought crime
1984
Oh no rpm*sailcount/2!!!
Clowning as usual you know
It‚Äôs the drill
I can‚Äôt post c* ock anymore


Been gatekept gaslit and girlbossed away

guh
That is the most random reference
A lot of them are
It doesn‚Äôt matter the size as much as it does the number
Isn‚Äôt breathing a jojo reference
null stop making obscure sky lander references
It‚Äôs 2023
Not 2006
:3drevenge: I only had swap force
I feel terrible rn
R&D mech drill arm
Guren lagann moment
WAIT I HAD TRAP TEAM TOO
that one sucked ass
Imo
Personal opinion
It‚Äôs just so :snore:
Honestly I have a spare pc sitting in storage
I really should use it as a server
It‚Äôs specs are decent enough
But I just don‚Äôt know how lol
Nah that‚Äôs used for the private clockwork Dev server rn
LTT moment
I mean a decent i5 (don‚Äôt remember exactly what), decent storage (shit ssd tho), a 1060 and 16 gigs of ram
Are just sitting in my basement
In a shitty cube case
4 hours to midnight
Vs physics are multithreaded
Krunch uses threads like a sewing machine
:clueless:
Bro what the fuck are computer part names even
Just uses another thread smh
Because multithreading on C is fucking stupid
You‚Äôre Haz
Who is surprised
It is
By the way does anyone wanna see the shitty concept doodle of the clockwork logo vs the actual one
This was the original doodle
Made it in class
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1059571325741568000/1067547047818952755/ClockworkLarge.png
You can kinda see the resemblance
:Gun_But_Better:
No don‚Äôt make me into a generic create logo üò¢
Was too noisy
Yeah but every create logo is vectorized
Look closer trol

LMFAOOO
THE GLINT IS THE SCHEMATIC BACKGROUND
LOLL
Wdym
It‚Äôs the infuser
Yes it represents the infuser
Also it‚Äôs a storm cloud lmao
LMAO
:3drevenge:
Ingenuity
Haz made it work
With a drone
but haz is also haz
And blimps
They use tethers
When vsbodies so I can add harpoon gun tethers
What
That‚Äôs easy
I mean it would be perfect if the world height was still 256
There‚Äôs 256 rotation
Speeds
I mean you control the tiny ballooner with rpm
Ingenuity :trol:
You‚Äôre just not smarting smart enough Ewou
Haz turned the command seat into an 8 output drone controller
Christ almighty
Do you want the logo parts
That would make it way easier
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1064336506258468864/1067594208585732207/ClockworkLogoParts.zip
Here they are anyways
:trol:
Well yeah if anyone steals part of the logo it‚Äôs gonna be pretty fuckin obvious
The parts are all massive
Because that peripheral can resize ships
There is one
:goosemath:
NO
How will ewou live
Damn everyone left
and I‚Äôm stuck in school
:(
let me out
Rattling the bars of my enclosure
Why don‚Äôt you use a vectorizer tool on the layers /j
Also this isn‚Äôt vector art
Yeah but this ain‚Äôt even technically vector art
The V is far too defined
Also the V isn‚Äôt just one piece
It has too many sharp edges
soon
Like give me another 2 weeks at least
clockwork 3D
Read up pls

Bout two
The polishing phase approaches
The storm one could say
A *lot*
#1 Propellors need a total rework
Plus bug testing
Seriously though
Why is there no analog gearshift in base create
It‚Äôs so simple
The majority of the code for the Redstone Resistor is literally just the visual aspect of it
Since the Redstone in its center glows a different shade of red depending on power input
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1059571325741568000/1067547047818952755/ClockworkLarge.png
You can mount them on lecterns
I forgot if they work or not though lol
My guy
The propellor is a create contraption
Everything does
Like what
ü§®
Ruby fixed that already i thought
Carriage works
It‚Äôs always worked
That‚Äôll be fixed with vsbodies
Not with mixins
Yeah but detecting when it collides rn is horrifically laggy
What no the point of vsbodies is that it won‚Äôt do that
:mental:
Ewou you need to catch up
With like
Everything that‚Äôs happened over this week
lmfao
When on a ship contraptions are being added to its collision shape via VSBodies
Oneway
The point of vsbodying the contraptions is to make them have world collision
When on a ship
So they don‚Äôt clip through the floor
And then diasssmble
And send you into the stratosphere
Bro I‚Äôm in an ap Java class rn
So we‚Äôre learning about fuckinf arrays
I wonder if I know what an array is
It‚Äôs not flight
You‚Äôd be pushing off the ground
???
That‚Äôs not what flight is
Do I fly when I take a step
That wouldn‚Äôt work anyways
That‚Äôs just not how physics work
Wait
HECK MOJANG IS GONE
How is mic supposed to mald now
It‚Äôs not a rope it‚Äôs rigid
It‚Äôs like a pole
Lmfao
It‚Äôs only gonna be a rope when we vsify it later
For now it is literally a pole
My guy that‚Äôs just not how that works
Do you realize how slow pulleys are
They are abysmal
Even with 256 rpm
They are
Abysmal
No they aren‚Äôt
Not at all
Ewou forgets how flying works colorized
My guy it‚Äôs create logic
You wanna talk stupid
Soon
But in create the pulley has the power to drain oceans
So
Really who‚Äôs laughing
Ewou I feel like you‚Äôre reading too deep into the mod that lets you move mountains with a single piston and some glue
You can do it with a rope too
Or what about crossing the Atlantic with a single bearing
Or what about storing said entire mountain in a minecart
And then picking it up
With a wrench
And carrying it away
:clueless:
It does tho if there‚Äôs any space whatsoever below it
Okay real talk
Have you ever actually used the rope pulley
Now think about this
Push a drill firmly into the ground
And drill through it
Vs2 is the physics coremod
Eureka is an addon
Clockwork is an addon
Takeoff is an addon
Tournament is an addon
Etc
Eureka is not the main mod despite what popular belief seems to be
Takeoff is out
Tournament is takeoff ++
It expands on takeoff‚Äôs test features
But it lacks a few things
Notably anything actually saving :trol:
It‚Äôs just downloadable
Takeoff in its current state is a joke
It‚Äôs so early in Dev that what it has rn is not what will be in the final mod
#tournament
Takeoff is gonna be an entire tech mod built on vs
But for rn it‚Äôs the 3am crackden
Clockwork at home
one could say
someone send the GitHub packages video
clhoxkwork I
cockfight
Incredible
Paid off I swear
Fish bowl
Mekapi
:trol:
Nah 1.18 worldgen really is nice
1.19 made it slower though somehow
Like mc had an amazing update
And then fucking
Ruined it
What
What on gods green earth is that
Cause you‚Äôre building in the world grid but not the ship grid
That‚Äôs a compat issue
No it‚Äôs a compat issue
Probably
Ewou figured it out
Constraints not saving is getting fixed in lod I think
@Triode when constraints seralized
Just did
Redstone Resistor
Ya know
Isn‚Äôt the analog lever supposed to also change color
I could‚Äôve sworn it did
But it isn‚Äôt
In the video I sent
Just noticed that
Maybe my flywheel shat the bed
The band is supposed to
It‚Äôs a partial
The resistor is far more visible
A few people for cherry picked
Null was one but if he doesn‚Äôt stop asking for build :3drevenge:
I love dungeons what
Dungeons is good
By the way the reason the shaft breaks with the resistor is a create feature that unintentionally works in our favor
Essentially things in create have a tally system
If they have too many speed changes or updates too quickly
They will break
And as it turns out rapidly speeding something up more than 15 times is enough to break
Yeah I know
It‚Äôs a tad sus
It‚Äôs because of how ship assembly works atm
And how create blocks work for that matter
They store their speed as an NBT value
But then when you move and recreate those blocks with said nbt
What they don‚Äôt save is their source
So they suddenly think they have speed on their own
And any connected source breaks
It‚Äôs a difficult problem to solve
What really should happen is
When moved kinetic blocks should be forced to run detachKinetics(); and then reattachKinetics();
But I‚Äôm unsure how
Not every create block has that function tho
And a lot of them don‚Äôt have it at all
Or have an override of it
It‚Äôs part of KineticTileEntity
But
Most things in create override everything in there anyways
Also not everything with rotational power is a KineticTileEntity
Some are SafeTileEntity or SmartTileEntity or fuckin
Boilerplate hell
Wdym
Why wouldn‚Äôt they
No they don‚Äôt
Lol
That‚Äôs the creative motor tweakin
No not visually either
They speed up
There are a lot of mods

It‚Äôs an ai generated image lmao
Optifine more like
Closed sourcetifine
Yuh
It‚Äôs not worth maintaining compat with a closed source mod that intentionally breaks compat
:trol:
Oculus does load
I use oculus
Check his roles
:goosemath:
Impact damage planned
With wings, a farter, a bearing, and some good luck
Yes
Don‚Äôt use takeoff wings tho they broken as hell
Use debug
No
Tournament doesn‚Äôt save
:clueless:
Takeoff will save as long as you don‚Äôt use wings or magnets
Worlds
When you exit it corrupts the world rn
Lmfao
Kinda
Partial corrupt
Just gotta remove the ship
But that‚Äôs :3drevenge:

Where‚Äôs the create kaboom team when we need them
@CeoOfGoogle
And missiles and stuff
Make kaboom
:3drevenge:
How am I supposed to clown in the clockwork trailer if I can‚Äôt fire a heat seeking gear powered missile at your face
Oh not nukes no
But boom
When vs physics bombs so I can rain hellfire
:clueless:
If you do decide to get off the fence about vs2 I will help you maintain a vs2 version of the mod
Well kaboom is like
Buildable bombs
Shouldn‚Äôt actually
Especially since the ship will be erased in like 5 seconds
Kaboom physics bombs were waiting for aero right
If you make a vs2 version I will assist
:trol:
Fans do produce thrust
that‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt experienced multithreaded krunch
Coming with lod
When lod
lod
Mekapi is post lod
Pensive
Who is the owner again
I forgor
Triode does
It‚Äôs like a few thousand concurrent ships or bust is the goal
Rn I think about 200 are stable
With multithreading that‚Äôll be more
Not efficient enough tho
He shall continue to krunch
Or something like that
Ahh
I thought it was the uh
Other guy
No one cares really so go ahead
No the other other guy
The one who owns like 12 addons
And they all just add blocks
Cause people who like physics mods
Like physics mods
ü§Ø
LMAO
Revelations in vs2 general i swear
Wait a minute
Why is insta an anime boy now
Insta got turned into a god damn eboy
What the heeeeeee
Insta is :goosemath:
the Neanderthal captioned aero fans be like versus the shitty Jpg of annoying orange captioned vs2 fans be like
Who would win
Oi don‚Äôt bash aero too much or they‚Äôll screencap your post, put a filter on it and an impact font caption, and then spam it whenever they‚Äôre in an argument
1.8 potpvp duels
You can sit on create seats they just have a suspicious offset
Clockwork fixes it temporarily but actually we made a PR to create
It‚Äôs a bug to do with distance
Same thing happened with trains and we PR‚Äôd that too
Yes you can use trains on ships
Also if trains have wings you can use them for lift
Because contraptions on ships that have wings work
It‚Äôs very sus
Actually you theoretically could do that for
Moving wings
:Thonk:
You could have wings on a train and shift them around
Train jump
I want to train jump
How to get a train onto your ship
No it‚Äôs to enable flaps
But rotor wings are
A side effect
Vsified contraptions won‚Äôt be all in the first release cause as it turns out replacing the contraption system even partially is hard
But eventually every contraption will have a VS variant
Discord pls
Discord took its set time
Sweet time
Also please stop ping replying
There is an option to not lmao
But
Not contraptions on ships
Vsified contraptions
Contraptions with physics
Like a rope pulley that acts like a rope
Contraptions with physics
That already will
Distance check being sus
Oh wait
That PR wasn‚Äôt merged yet right
Okay so next create update lol
Actually are you using 0.5h
Precisely :trol:
I wanna be able to just yeet myself
Off the rail
Nah it‚Äôs g patch 1 now
But g patch 1 isn‚Äôt compatible
With clockwork
No the piston wouldn‚Äôt bend but it would have momentum
And maybe be able to generate rotation in a certain mode
Are you picking up what I‚Äôm putting down
H does now I believe
No just use latest vs2
Get beta 10
Fixes that bug
You aren‚Äôt supposed to be sent to the shadow realm
Ah bet
Skill
Haz used wings and propellors to make a perfectly balanced quad copter
Nah
Cringe
Too easy
Just use a balloon burner
V
In clockwork
Yeah you can but like
They aren‚Äôt gonna mesh well gameplay wise
Yes but like why
Redstone ‚ú®
And propellors
Gonna be honest captain I didn‚Äôt write the balloon seal code, Ruby‚Äôs job
So I don‚Äôt know lmfao
I believe it‚Äôs just based off the volume of connected balloons
Also due to lag reasons breaking the balloon will cause the burner to be permanently off until you smack it with a wrench
Because we don‚Äôt want to constantly spam floodfill checks
And krunch air pocket detection doesn‚Äôt exist yet
I‚Äôm talking about clockwork
Copper keeps saying krunch
:clueless:
No
actually vs2 is
what isn't optimized is create
create runs like ass
fun fact, the "This is Create (2022)" video is actually not realtime
the engine was slowed and then the game sped up due to unplayable framerates
üíÄ

nono
because shaders disable flywheel optimizations
and without flywheel optimizations
fun fact
flywheel on its own is an incredible performance mod
you wanna know why you never see a difference
because create itself offsets it with the lag
it aint open rn
and probably wont be until ~0.1.5
so we'll do 0.1
nah when i say its a mess it's partially because we're a frankenstein between create fabric and create forge
and
that leads to true horror

yes
it is
i couldve forced it to comply by ints
but its more fun if you can have decimal level precision
is there a whole lotta reason for it? ...no
but
its fun
:Thonk:
well you can actually get
the speed as a precise number using display links
hmmmmm
there is no NAN value possible
you cant divide by 0 its a multiplier not a divisor

the fog
but what did you want
with this
the fog is coming
it has no eureka features so
it wont have the same config
it is possible
just not through normal gameplay
create uses floats to handle rotation which can handle decimals
yeah
because this isnt changing create
this is literally just something create has
that you normally cant access
What
I got ping
no
because no
no what threw me off was
"The" clockwork server
implying the official one
1-2 weeks
No
:trol:
Almost like I already said it
ü§®
There aren‚Äôt vsbodies yet
Propellorhead is not a vs body
He is the boy
You put shame on his name
He is dead
How could you
Yes he is
The gravitron killed him
It betrayed him in his darkest hour
:guh:
Horrific
skybound dm'd me about becoming the official clockwork server
i turned them down for now
im not interested in their style of server being the thing clockwork is focused around
ooh...
that could be neat
buuut
the bungee main server would have to be modless
its unfortunate that i cant have at least just clockwork in the hub since mod channel mismatch
yeah, its called having all the network servers use the same modpack
:clueless:
no
why do you want to host so bad
oooh
i kinda like that
so like a hub server but not actually connected
but the hub server could use the same modpack as the official server so it could still be used to connect to that or any subservers
if only forge had hot-swappable mods
then you could make people download
as they join
that doesnt work lol
that's forge
forge doesnt let you swap mods without restarting
no
üíÄ
no there isnt
:clueless:

i used a combination of several power levels
cope
five whole bytes
an entire 5
well its a shitload
of them
and i can get sponsored by bisecthosting
so
:trol:
torque is kinda funky
with create
create stuff just doesn't
have a torque
clockwork will have more than aero
when its done

release date will be known averagely-soon
very
what does the torsion spring do again
create doesn't consider torque but vs2 has torque
so create-powered vs stuff
will have accurate torque
that aint a spring
im confused
spring isnt really that important considering we have the command seat
also conflicts with another spring item
that clockwork has
^
the spring in clockwork is a kinetic energy storage device
essentially a windup battery
its for short-term flight aircraft as they have a MASSIVE stress capacity but burn through their stored energy the more stress they're under
clockwork is bad piggies clearly
we even wanted to make sticky wheels using constraints
one time use soda pop thrusters for missiles
:Thonk:
i back you up
NOOO WAY
COCK
WHY IS THAT NOT AUTOMODDED
I CAN SAY COCK

hey it says gullible on the ceiling
dont get your hopes up its valkyrien computers

well they're devs
thats why they have cock

i have just had a revelation
cbc cannons should have stupid recoil on ships
especially massive ones
https://tenor.com/view/potato-cannon-linus-acetylene-recoil-kick-back-gif-16438820
hmm
i wonder if ill have time to include the Potato Autocannon before 0.1 or if thats gonna come with 0.1.5
i should really model it
:clueless:
waiting on lod and vsbodies
but yes obv
might not be until 0.2 tho which will be the second major update of c*ockwork
Land N Sea
(name pending)
hmm
bad piggies synthetic orchestra
:clueless:

Clockwork 0.1: To the Skies
0.1.5 is the massive airship mid-update
so
and bote
no reason to split car and bote into seperate updates imo
unless we want content updates to be really small
hmm
if we split botes into 0.3 we could focus on adding more polish to specifically cars and then specifically boats with less of a wait time for the individuals
is it worth devving them seperately
maybe i should make this a poll
smash everything ü§®
true
fern outcraft and null
all collectively failed to assemble a flap bearing
:clueless:
bro the flap bearing is the baby's first clockwork block and it was confusing people üòì
or maybe
fern is just slow
I will fix it when i vsify trains
:trol:
artillery train moment
yet they want to do esports
:Confus:
im so confused
they allegedly have a deal with
twitch rivals
im not sure about something that isnt out yet and is entirely closed source having a partnership with the largest streaming service on the planet
but
probably i dunno
you can in vs2 at least
:clueless:
yeah lo
we don't know much about aero
we just know about our mod
ye we dont
we simply keep on keepin on
ü§®
>types vs in aero server
>several people are typing
what they compensatin for
thats the question
well i have it
because i MADE IT
is a beta tester
and picked by me as someone i can trust alongside 2 other people
they have access to breaking builds
stuff we don't give to the ea people even
because they are meant to break the mod
as much as possible
no
im not giving you the source code üíÄ
yes
because 90% of people would immediately leak it
thats why all #playtesters dont have it
because most of them would leak it
simple as
there have been playtest leaks before but they mostly dont matter since vs2 is open source anyways
*but*
clockwork is not open source
and for a reason
nah
its to do with polish
i doubt aero wants anything to do with our code considering a majority of it relies on vs2 and their engine is very different
supposedly
either way
doesn't matter
and a little bit after 0.1 because the codebase is :guh:
a mess rn
yeah
itll be closed source until about 0.1.5 tho
for cleanup purposes
i will obfuscate it myself
personally
your jar only
:clueless:
release date uhhhh
hmm
whats todays date actually
i dont remember
so around
2/07-2/16 range maybe?
no promises
and that'll be when its done not necessarily the release date
the release date will be pushed a little back because we plan to have a few pre-release events
thats not a release date
that's a "mod done" date
itll be released a bit after the mod is actually done lol
it isnt
you see
hype
:clueless:
^^
but thats why
we already testin
startin today and movin forward
we will be testing as we dev until we're ready
there are still a few features that need to be implemented
namely the
then its entirely just bugtesting
after that list is checked off
no lol
not for a first release
im not releasing an unpolished product
not beeeg hot air balloon
the little guy
for blimps
itll be in 0.1
the giant scalable-up-to-5x5x5 one will be 0.1.5
modlist?
logs?
version?
its so visually polished you can't see the boilerplate hellscape codebase
i dont even see anything
related to vs2 on that
the physics thread isnt lagging
yes
lol
also its just hideous in general
ye obv
but for 0.1.5 the scalable balloon burner will probably be the main attraction
that thing is gonna need
the baddest of ass textures
no
create version scheme
bugfixes are

we're using create's naming system
clown
its a create addon
:diesofdeath:
minor spelling mistake
i win
create did kinda skip to
0.3.2
lol
capitalization is unnecessary in a casual context
as is punctuation
major major
i mena
fuck
minor spelling mistake
i lose
i mean, mc is 1.<major>.<minor>
if mc ever hit a 2.0 it would be a major-major update
idk i dont know the term
major squared
bruh thats bigger than the entirety of 0.5
üíÄ
0.3.1
i mean in sheer listed additions
0.5 added trains
not the size of content but the sheer number amount of it
bruh
:sus:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtqWZS7rUM
smh
also i guess clockwork is just a mainstay in shalz vids now
:clueless:
what mixin
i dont think the cannon carriage is in any way obvious ngl
i didn't even know what it did :clueless:
i thought it was just a fancy mount
they actually arent just unbound
they're bound to keyboard 0
which causes opengl errors
üòÖ
thought it was clockwork for a minute when we found the issue but
no
it was cbc
üëº
that's the spirit
tech made like 3 addons so he has access
it's because the playermodel is being rotated but not the actual player
vs2 actually rotates the player when seated
cbc doesn't
with mine it would look like  my goggles have taken a vacation
simply do not experience a skill issue
of course the time i get 12 dms about clockwork because of shalz ivdeo is
same time i am in
job meet
:clueless:
#showcase
or me through my kofi
:diesofdeath:
https://ko-fi.com/theplasticpotato :clueless:
simply wait then :trol:
we've made all of the content for the mod so far in just a single month
so
give us some time

pleas
:diesofdeath:
unfortunately that happens
what did he do anyways
:diesofdeath:
oh bruh
rip shalz
:bz_true:
oh that video
the one with the cobblestone house
speaking of popular videos
flight of the idiot almost at 30k
nevermind the fact that shalz's video has 232k üòÖ
yeah
yes
ive never gotten over 5k views so of course
28.9k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybix8t-GuKM
true
one day
it shall
ive gotten literally all of my subscribers in the past

i should really finish my next clockwork video
i need to crash a plane into a blimp
i tried to keep clockwork's style at least tangentially vanilla-y
so it fits in with create mostly
nah
im not cooler than shalz
shalz has the glasses bro
i have no chance
its called The Idiot for a reason
hell its control surfaces are backwards
LMAO
that was a bug
fixed
also i was looking through my comment history (i really dont comment often) and i found an ancient one on one of @Dapheni's videos :clueless:
my two biggest videos are both

yeah

hmmm
or do i work on bloons
im in a job meet but like
its just nonsense
:clueless:
no
clockwork and aero are not related
id imagine a downgrade
but clockwork is not a downgrade smh
well it will
every time it strikes twelve it updates
so once 0.1 drops
itll keep ticking until 0.2
and so on
would you mind making a #support thread with logs and your modlist?
mario has invaded
is that actually the 64 mod

you know i had to do it to em

bowling would be easier
ships can be resized
doesn't let you build on ships
you can get to the shipyard
but its
the equivalent of the backrooms
lmfao
you dont wanna go there
no
use beta 10 and you wont
yes
the shipyard doesn't load chunks like normal chunks
i see no need to copy aero features
however ive added some that people keep asking for
like the redstone resistor
i still havent done a roadmap
add a clockwork tag to #feature-requests
:clueless:
ironic
also speaking of feature requests
just went through like half of the feature requests
there are so many duplicates
bro how the fuck is that gonna slide into your pocket
wearing jeans
my guy its 90% rubber
i do
rather humorously
it actually would work for Clockwork
ü§®
i was going to write a server management mini-addon for the clockwork modpack when i make it
i never said i would
im just saying that would work for clockwork
because it uses newshipfromblocks
lol
clockwork ships actually have a limit üòÖ
its called "nobody is gonna craft that much bluperglue"
unless you mean amount of ships
sure, but
cant you place blocks after assemblinga  eureka ship
ü§®
we do kinda need to draw the line where compat ends and integration begins tho
some features are completely broken in base vs2 but then they have a mixin file the size of nebraska
so
no as in
they dont just fix it
they have integration and a fix in the same mixin
the banned role are artists
streaming
i fixed propellors
:clueless:
:Thonk:
yes
i should
üòì
they aren't all bad people but there are some that are
er
yeah.
lets say that
i am a lone warriro
against their
armada
and i will still release before 2024
agreed
show me a video of it flying
when i make the obligatory anime intro for clockwork's official server i will include that song as a motif /j

just has like
a five second part of the intro with that song as the motif

vs2 and aero discords stop trying to be at eachother's throats for five minutes challenge
impossible
i leave for literally
five minutes
come back
you speak as a member of the aero discord trying to start shit on both sides
and vs2 has had its fair share of people like you too
people need to learn that
jfc
sure we may throw the occasional shitty joke or jpg of a neanderthal
but yall seriously all treat this like its a war
going into the aero server and claiming people here were "Shit talking" aero members
is
starting shit
most of them are
just not on mains
:clueless:
i don't really care about anyone's personal opinions on aero or vs2
all i care is that the joking about eachother end at joking and not turn into genuine malice
like gamers
i dont wanna 1984
but at this rate its gonna end up like forge vs fabric lol
and we don't want a repeat of that üíÄ
its alright
vs2's weakness is a lack of content but that is actively being fixed
both mods are not meant to be dueling peaks
they stand on their own merits
for their own reasons

:bz_true:
clockwork is still keeping on keepin on
clockwork will have its own wheels and use belts as treads
mekapi is for self contained vehicles entirely/mostly out of vsbodies
wheels wont
well they will need lod

i cant even work on them until lod
they wont be hard
at all

if you continuously shit on aero you are doing nothing but making yourself look like an ass

oh god fucking damnit not again
me when flywheel changes entire rendering system in minor update
thats good considering they're ass shit for performance rn
unplayable with shaders
and not super playable even without when you have large contraptions
if its just rendering changes
not terrible
shaders force off the flywheel optimizations
and i think the bridge mod to make flywheel work with shaders
is broken by vs2
the physics mod
you mean?
i think their dev added compat
99% sure
which is neat
me when paid mod

imma be honest i didn't get a ton of coding done this weekend :clueless:
after 4 straight weeks of funny
need a minute
i think i can get something done tonight if i really push for it but
i might just finish it tomorrow and post about it then
AI mioment
mama mioment
all i accomplished today was memeing a bit, coding half the feature i wanted to finish, and messaging a hosting service about a partnership for the official clockwork server
so like
:diesofdeath:
runs on the souls of the innocent
or more accurately
donut frosting
:clueless:
you need a minimum of like 1k modpack downloads
i just went for it myself since the requirements for a mod are different
and i have 30k views on an untagged meme video
so evidently its big enough to get attention
:clueless:
will probably be like
3-5 days i think it said until i get a reply
i still really need to work on my video but like i need to work on so much else too
"To the skies with VS Clockwork!" is my working title for the video im making
its a rundown of the mod's features and some eye candy vessels to boot
it's not the "This is Clockwork" video tho
that'll be all eye candy
klarkson ai‚Äôd
the beyond earth dev actually was a sussy individual
like
bad
real bad
doesn't deserve a by-name mention bad
when vsbodies
wh
tjeu ,ade ANPTJER PME
i had a stroke
they made another one??
yes
they have
you can translate that to
"they made ANOTHER ONE"
:diesofdeath:
maybe our PR
oh its just a hotfix patch
nvm
smh
i have no idea
flywheel probably
they intend to rewrite it you know
learned that from someone here 30 minutes ago
cant wait for that
no early cockwork for you
i dont get why i can say cockwork but if i add a censor to it it blocks it
no
flywheel is actually a
pretty decent rendering engine
but as you can guess
its optimizations are offset by create
being laggy as shit
prop rework is a little goofy
its actually nothing to do with the rework tho
its to do with the fix of their exhaust velocity
yes
essentially
for testing
i turned down their thrust multiplier
while fixing their values
forgot to crank it back up
they have a multiplier of 5 rn
they're supposed to have one of 50
:clueless:
fuck it
turning the multiplier up to an absurd number
lets try 1000
:clueless:
honestly
im convinced this multiplier isn't
thats because of your props mate
its like trying to turn the titanic
you see the issue was
before
props were driven by a thing's length squared
which meant exponenttial
which meant
no speed at all
but if you had 256
too much speed
and all of the middle ones
did jack shit
jfc propellors really are piss weak
even with a multiplier of 1000
this seems better
you see its
really really hard to tell
when youve hit the sweet spot of
not too strong
not too weak
maybe i should add a readout for their thrust output...
ehh but then id have to calculate their force on gametick
very cringe
or maybe i could send it back somehow?
@Triode
is there a way i could send back the total force and total torque applied by the propellor
to the tile entity
so i could add it to the goggles readout
and i definitely dont wanna run the force calculation twice
its a lotta math
that's wasting processing power
well i have a variable
a pair of vecs
scalar number
but i can just .length
right
torque i can do vec
but force
nah i know how id show a vector and whatnot its just about sending that data back to the prop
i guess i could make the update propellor function return a pair of vectors?
rather than being a void as it is now
thats how i send back the propellor id in createPropellor
well i calculate the force in the controller is what i mean
i know that its just about sending it back to the block entity so i can have it display alongside the other stuff when you inspect it with goggles lmao
shouldnt be too hard tho
cause im still using ship controllers
oh
üíÄ
im an idiot
incredible
it truly took all the collective brainpower of the minecraft modding community to realize
Running on ‚ú® 2 and a half hours of sleep
no
They‚Äôve denied it themselves
Technically they aren‚Äôt breaking curseforge TOS unless they actually actively try to prevent compat
But denying it sends the message
Compatibility being made
They don‚Äôt want the mods to boot together
yeah
Ryan and the team have stated they don‚Äôt want vs2 and aero to even run in the same game
No issue if they don‚Äôt interact
No
They won‚Äôt launch simultaneously
That‚Äôs what Ruby means by compat
Simultaneous launching without an immediate crash
No they wouldn‚Äôt even boot
lol
?
If you use eureka
Yes
But krunch is anything but spastic
I‚Äôm confused then on how the physics are spastic
Oh
Now it makes sense
The two most broken addons
Tournament doesn‚Äôt even support breaking the blocks (they will still apply ghost forces)
Takeoff won‚Äôt save
Or literally anything in takeoff other than farters and balloons
üòÖ
Well clockwork doesn‚Äôt change interaction
Clockwork just isn‚Äôt poorly coded
Was it debug wings or takeoff wings
Mega sus wing code moment
Yeah something was fucked and a half with your game
Wings don‚Äôt just produce lift
Magically
Yes but from what
Ballasts are just weight
They don‚Äôt provide a force
That‚Äôs physically impossible
And especially for infinite acceleration it‚Äôs doubly impossible
:Thonk:
Laws of thermodynamics are sobbing rn
are you using the latest GitHub package vs2?
Ah
Cf might be bugged
I always just go with github ngl
Hmm
Maybe I‚Äôm just used to the clockwork wings with a custom angle of attack but I‚Äôve never been able to produce infinite lift
And I‚Äôve made some stupid shit in testing
oh yeah
Any tournament block after breaking will just
Breaking them will cause ghost forces cause the controller is never properly deleted
I wonder if engines keep providing force if you break the helm or something :Thonk:
I have never tried that
But it could be the case
Especially since your shitbrick is just
A flat plain
It shouldn‚Äôt have stayed stable
something was royally fucked
But ballasts aren‚Äôt even like
They‚Äôre just a weighted block
By that logic you could use literally any block with the ballast‚Äôs weight
Wdym
By independently moving
Oohhh wait
Or bearing of some kind
ah there‚Äôs your issue
Constraints are‚Ä¶ strange right now
They aren‚Äôt perfectly stable
Or really even
smh
But yeah you probably encountered a whoopsie debug hinge moment
Takeoff balloons
Good god
You know wings and flaps work on bearings right
üòÖ
Yeah
It‚Äôs in the engine
Not clockwork feature
Triode had to add it to vscore
Yeah
Any contraption actually
Trains included
Which is mega cursed
that isn‚Äôt toggling them
That‚Äôs just fucking up your aerodynamics
Wings or flaps?
Triode might have made it only work with things that have 0 angle of attack :Thonk:
But I know for a fact it‚Äôs in base vs
@Haz made a non clockwork plane
Using it
Car
Physical mechanisms moment
@Triode wings might be sussy
I c
Wdym when do you get angular momentum
The farter power
No I‚Äôm confused as to what you mean
We have angular momentum
Yes I‚Äôm aware
They‚Äôre either piss weak or overpowered depending on how they feel in a day
They also calculate their position on gametick üòì
So they are
Incredibly unstable
Yes they do
It‚Äôs called use something other than eureka
ü§®
Nah it doesn‚Äôt brick your game
Unless you get there through nefarious ways
Like blowing up a ship made entirely of just a eureka helm while riding it
Oh by the way it‚Äôs coming with lod probably but
Right now everything collides as if it were a full block
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve found that in your gearmaking
Krunch will respect real blockshapes soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
You can already add custom voxelshapes I think but that‚Äôs manual
No it‚Äôs because of engine detail
Like block properties
Friction, bounciness
A tad
ü§®
Did you have any other mods
Huh I don‚Äôt see any conflicts there
What is createbb
Is it create building blocks or something
Oh no
It‚Äôs broken bad
Why did they change the jar file name
It‚Äôs a disgrace of an addon
It doesn‚Äôt need a fabric port it‚Äôs literally five items
And a fluid
Horrific quality
CANT even use the items yourself
Nah bro 1.12 mods aren‚Äôt that bad
It‚Äôs like a 1.3 mod
Jar edit type beat
That‚Äôs the type of shit I‚Äôd put in my mc version jar
Back in the days of
Tekkit classic
Grand craft auto
create broken worse
when
I like how over the weekend when I had free time and sleep
I didn‚Äôt wanna code
But now that I‚Äôm sitting in class
Running on 2 hours of sleep
At 8am
I want to code
Jfc
Can my motivation be slightly less inconvenient for once
Smh
Clockwork 0.1 is really close to being done content wise
Like really, really close
I have about 5 things left to implement and then I need to grind out polish
Yeah
Create naming scheme
Reaction wheels continue to elude me
On release
I don‚Äôt wanna make them lame but like making them interesting is har
Nah they ain‚Äôt
They stop you from spinning
When you are in a death spin
They are very useful
And they also won‚Äôt be a get out of jail free card
can only apply so much torque
Reminder that this addon is for create users
Who like difficulty but
Not as much as they say they do
They want realism but really they want to be handheld through realism
Nah bro I‚Äôve got a bunch of empty periods
The alternative is talking on discord
which is worse
I wish I had my laptop smh
Me no have case still
I‚Äôve had my laptop for literally a month
Hasn‚Äôt left the house
Clockwork adds to the magic part of it while keeping the steampunk
Mixed with a little bit of whimsy dieselpunk because combustion engine but whimsical dieselpunk is just steampunk++
The infuser
:clueless:
It‚Äôs not like
Le lame magic mod magic tho
:3drevenge:
funky one
And decent specs
Plenty good for mc modding
I don‚Äôt have a 3070 in mine
Thin actually
Metal frame
Silent unless it‚Äôs on your lap
Think so
Cause the fans are on the base of it
A mix
It‚Äôs a real second display
But has touch capacity
I think idk
Ah yes the company that made me pay to use color in my photoshop projects
Which is why I swapped to rebelle 6
üíÄ

I know it‚Äôs adobe‚Äôs fault
I‚Äôm just too lazy to care who to blame
I have the cc but actually
Cause student
let me just say
Adobe products fucking suck
If I didn‚Äôt get this for dirt cheap because of student discount i would never think of paying
It‚Äôs actually terrible
Yeah
Big laptop
But thin
And quiet
It‚Äôs a little cramped admittedly tho
Yeah
But it‚Äôs good
Smooth
Yeah no I‚Äôm not using that thing‚Äôs touchpad
The screen might be good
I can‚Äôt say the same thing as the trackpad
then again no trackpad is good
It isn‚Äôt actually
The screen folds in
0.81 inches
I don‚Äôt know how many mm that is
Or if that‚Äôs accurate
It weighs like a pound tho
Yeah it does have good cooling
Dead silent
Unless you set it not to be lol
Lmfao
A good chunk of the laptop‚Äôs surface is grated for vents
So it has good airflow
Again unless you have it on your lap
If you have the laptop on your lap
That will block like half its airflow
:clueless:
But nobody sits with a workstation laptop on their legs
Unless they feel like fusing their legs together
Nono it‚Äôs specifically like
Soft material of stuff
A hard table it rests above enough to not care
Yeah
It‚Äôs essentially like smothering it
It still has plenty of airflow even when on a bed or legs but it will get hot
And when it gets hot you will wish it wasn‚Äôt on your lap
Lmfao
I haven‚Äôt tried with the ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù or ‚Äúsilent‚Äù airflow modes off tho
I wonder if it‚Äôd still get hot if I set it to ‚Äúfull cooling‚Äù :clueless:
Just haven‚Äôt wanted to sacrifice my hearing
Ye
So the heat is diffusing into my goddamn leg
But yeah I like the thing
It‚Äôs sturdy
And it‚Äôs fast
But I don‚Äôt get to use it
Because no case
And they don‚Äôt make a case for it specifically so I have to use a generic one and I‚Äôm scared LMAO
17
It‚Äôs real big
Still mostly thin
Especially for fitting good cooling, two screens, and a full keyboard
I‚Äôd say that thing is compact as hell
Bro
Now that‚Äôs a thick laptop

Meanwhile
The ports are almost as thick as the frame :clueless:
It‚Äôs called any Apple laptop before 2012
By the way this thing doesn‚Äôt have an intel processor which is probably why it doesn‚Äôt have shit thermals /j
Has a Ryzen 9 6900HX
ü§®
It works perfectly fine for me
10850k here
surprisingly decent temps
Yes
It runs literally anything I throw at it
Even stupid vs2 stuff
So I‚Äôll take it
I really need to test
I‚Äôm just busy with clockwork
Got spanish class I‚Äôll brb
Temporary life
Rather annoyingly it seems a new phone policy might be instated meaning even if I have an empty period I won‚Äôt be allowed to use my phone
But if I had my laptop I would be able to use it üíÄ
Photoshop doesn‚Äôt have a permanent license
One of Clockwork‚Äôs features actually takes advantage of this
just got home
Or not home
But out of class
Made a little fella while in science

aloha
turn it on in config
no
the mod is open source
well base vs2 is
clockwork is closed rn
but if you want the latest build of base vs2 or any of the open addons rn
you can download them with github packages
it is in the eureka config file
1.19 port is in the works
AlphaMode was working on it last i checked
not a hard port
just merge conflict issues rn
alpha is also on like
12 porting teams tho
so he'll get to it when he gets to it

the api update and new lod will probably
shatter the current 1.19 port anyways

the reason you lost so much speed and died at the end

someone mentioned mechs

Yes, you can ask me
However as someone who knows me rather well I can tell you me‚Äôs reply
It‚Äôs no
Alpha only does forward ports
Correct
I have gotten seven dms overnight
Fluid drag yes
But it‚Äôs a config
:3drevenge:
I need do are make mod
Before I do are make trialed
Trailer
Or Continuum :clueless:
But continuum is so far away from starting it might as well not exist
Nah continuum is what I‚Äôm gonna use #universal for
:clueless:
Was originally an idea I had for base clockwork but base clockwork doesn‚Äôt really need space
Nah probably as Astra
Ad Astra
Enter the Potatoverse
Beyond earth is just worse ad astra
Which is worse galacticraft
That‚Äôs why tech is making Valkyrien drive
:trol:
There are no good ones
but galac
:trol:
There will be an official one
With a server
No
The official one
*partnered with bisecthosting :trol:*
Bruh nah I‚Äôm not even allowed to use my phone in study hall anymore
But kids be using their laptops
I need to get my laptop case
:diesofdeath:
Clockwork‚Äôs release is waiting on me to finish what I need to code and then polish and then work on the official server and some events
So it‚Äôll be roughly two weeks
Eh
Maybe
Events will be soon tho
The official server will open to the public the same day the mod drops
Alongside the officially supported modpack which I will create and make custom assets for
It‚Äôll be kinda like Above and Beyond
Since any mods we add, I will retexture or remodel to fit create‚Äôs aesthetic
Alongside the GUIs, main menu, and likewise
It might delay release a little though since making all those assets will take some time obv
But I think considering everything so far has been made and finished in record speed
It‚Äôll still come out some time in February so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm cyberpunking
One thing about the pack, I won‚Äôt be including any other vs2 addons
As all of them are
Incredibly broken in their current state
No
Official server releasing alongside clockwork
They‚Äôre already fixed in clockwork
Reason they don‚Äôt work is because shitty distance check
Tournament on its way to apply ghost forces to things entirely unrelated to it
https://tenor.com/view/monsters-inc-walk-epic-entrance-sully-gif-16331255
Really
What clockwork is waiting on
Is lod and Api
I need vsbodies for wheels and the potato autocannon
It is but clockwork doesn‚Äôt have it yet obv
Rn clockwork is still using ship controllers :diesofdeath:
Was it using tournament or takeoff
They don‚Äôt tend to like saving :clueless:
You using latest tournament?
Might fix it
I have no idea if that‚Äôs up to date
But it has a curseforge release now
They are approaching
And I will make sure that clockwork and it‚Äôs server are as polished as physically possible
I am split between using fabric and forge for the server tho
The dealbreaker for me is c2me
If c2me compat added
Fabric server
If not forge cause more create addons on forge
IE cringe
Create big cannons
:clueless:
I won‚Äôt be able to add enough weapons to clockwork that are good equivalents with the current release schedule
So we kinda need cbc
üòî
Yeah takeoff and tournament collectively suck ass
I should really disable takeoff downloads
It‚Äôs current state doesn‚Äôt represent what the mod even is
They do in base vs2
Takeoff does corrupt worlds
If you use wings
Or magnets
It‚Äôs just not as bad as tournament when that kind of thing happens
Because takeoff doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äú‚Äùcorrupt‚Äù‚Äù
No
I saw it now
I get a hundred dms a day don‚Äôt judge
:3drevenge:
The autocannon in cbc is like
400 rounds per minute max
Because of that
It‚Äôs also hella beta
Like very beta
It‚Äôs rounds look like red squares
Lmao
The clockwork Potato Autocannon will use create‚Äôs potato projectile entities so it can‚Äôt be krunchitized
Well mekapi is all physics so
There will work
But not in cockwork
Well mekapi plans to have living v-entities
Well for R&D‚Äôs abominations for the mech to fight
:clueless:
I need to make
A v entity with pathfinding
And health
Commands
:trol:
Do you have takeof fabric
It‚Äôs just listed as takeoff either way so are you sure
Clockwork‚Äôs server is gonna have a server management addon
Do you have Kotlin for Forge
They were
Shalz has distribution rights to his friends
Not to the public
All early accessors do
No sharing whatsoever
They haven‚Äôt
I won‚Äôt be for 9 more hours
:clueless:
What
No I think
They mean
the Physics Mod
Aka that paid mod thing
man‚Äôs running the raspberry pi
Wait no that‚Äôs a phone
It‚Äôs android
they made compat themselves
We don‚Äôt have anything on our end related to them because they‚Äôre closed source
They have actual compat
With vs2
Yeah but since waves not real no ship movement pensive
Block break effect should work on ships tho
Along with other stuff
We don‚Äôt do compat with closed source mods
Not something that can be done
Not real waves
So not real movement
üòî
Default boat doesn‚Äôt really move
It‚Äôs rendering
The Physics Mod is a very fancy shader with some extra doodads
Also that mod‚Äôs name is very confusing
No it‚Äôs just like
Actual physics mods exist
It doesn‚Äôt even add physics yet it‚Äôs called The physics mod
Cause I am little fella
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1069700923200389181/1069737224591114381/PotatotarPFPLarge.png

MC is fun but vanilla really just ain‚Äôt cutting it for me anymore tbh
I may be a mod Dev but I haven‚Äôt played any video games other than an hour of scrap mechanic and an hour of hello engineer since
November
:clueless:
I don‚Äôt really game
I feel sorry for you
How do you deal with that ratshit engine for over a thousand hours
You can‚Äôt even have a vessel get close to another on multiplayer or the entire game shits the bed
Vs2 :trol:
I could‚Äôve sworn that scrap mechanic wasn‚Äôt always like
Five fps
Has it gotten worse
Last time I played before last weekend was in 2018 üòÖ
So my memory‚Äôs a tad warped
It was actually unplayable
We couldn‚Äôt have more than like five vessels in existence
Literally a potato
It‚Äôs because scrap mechanic uses yucky physx
They suck ass and ball
And for some reason wheels have no like
Traction
At all
You just slide uncontrollably in any car
No suspension fixes sliding
That‚Äôs an engine thing
The wheels just have so little friction
That they are like ice
Man people need to stop trusting takeoff and tournament with their vehicles
It‚Äôs like trusting the water supply of flint michigan
Bro I made takeoff I know for a fact it doesn‚Äôt work fine
LMAO
Tournament tries to be an upgrade to what takeoff is rn
But it just breaks
Everything
That‚Äôs why I stick to takeoff
The world only corrupts when you use
Like
Anything other than farters and balloons
And everything other than farters and balloons doesn‚Äôt even work in takeoff so like
:clueless:
I mean farters don‚Äôt work either
They are STILL calculating force on gametick
Instead of physics tick
That‚Äôs why they spaz out at high speed
I‚Äôve never replaced it
Do they really :clueless:
They also do save
But they have like a 10% chance of crashing on world load
But hey
At least it‚Äôs not tournament‚Äôs farter equivalent
Sure you might be able to redstone control it
But
Can you reopen your world
:trol:
A lot of people aren‚Äôt so fortunate
Myself included trol
The dev server got corrupted by tourn
The server got corrupted
It‚Äôs not platform dependent problems
I know what the issue is
It‚Äôs that it‚Äôs copying takeoff code
So it has all of takeoff‚Äôs issues
Including the engine‚Äôs force transform I‚Äôm 90% sure
Just checked :trol:
Smh
Dust just isn‚Äôt interested in it at all anymore
Admittedly dust moves from idea to idea like a leapfrog but
About how long it took to make the features in it
Simply use clockwork trol

that was susly worded
Because I have a job
:clueless:
No

Trust me
I have plenty of time to work on the mod
And I use it
There‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôre this far and it‚Äôs only been a month
Realistically this addon should‚Äôve taken a long ass time to develop its first version even
Totally
Coked out of my mind
Nah bro it‚Äôs called adhd medication

I am on break
Hello gamers

I‚Äôm watching the video
Why are French youtubers smart

Agreed
Tournament blocks on their way to apply ghost forces to ships they have nothing to do with
https://tenor.com/view/sully-walk-monsters-inc-gif-16339267
Takeoff blocks other than the farter or balloon on their way to prevent world loading
What
:notsoshrimple:
I wanted to work on my channel layout but it‚Äôs almost 9 so I have no time to finish anything pensive
I need to make a bunch of assets for my YouTube channel so I can overproduce videos about clockwork
:clueless:
I think the theme of my channel is gonna be pixel art
So it switches between like
Pixel art animation
And retro game style
You must recognize the clockwork physics infuser then
:clueless:
I intend to have my channel be one of those like
Upload-every-3-months overproduced with animation type beat ones
Hence why I made the little fella

That‚Äôs what we call a one and done
I mean your new plane is very stable
But it turns like a horror show because you don‚Äôt have front flaps
you have to have them inverted from your back flaps
We‚Äôre picking up steam
The clockwork marketing grindset is working /j
Well that‚Äôs the point smh
Ruby moment
Man got shot down on two avenues
Vs2 collision gaming
Getting chosen by the mod dev
Soul economy got fucked when the population hit 8 billion
Too many souls in circulation
Someone mentioned something about an update waiting for lod
Would just like to make it known that clockwork itself is waiting for lod
So no update would be before lod
The real reason it might be best for the sea update to be after
Is that air pocket detection would be nice
Or alternatively a simplified fluid sim
Something entirely focused on deep sea content and subs is planned as a sub-update to the sea update
Like how giant airships are the first update‚Äôs sub-update
Boat related features
Sails that catch wind
Etc
Oars maybe
Clockwork‚Äôs sea update would bring winds and crosswinds :clueless:
Probably
But I know I defo want them for clockwork
Bonked
The block drag method mentioned before is kinda scuffed
Ya know
Everything is cubes
Cubes aren‚Äôt exactly aerodynamic
Clockwork is an all in one mod
Yeah
It‚Äôs scuffed as hell don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs far better than relying on whatever causes planes to slow down right now
At least it isn‚Äôt *=.99
That‚Äôs because of your wing setup
The way your wings are set up produces a shit load of drag when you try to turn
And as Ewou said
Would rip your wings apart if create contraptions physically could
Flaps don‚Äôt need that much surface
And that
Maybe I should add wing overstressing
Ehh but if I make wings stress
That could be confusing
Well in the instance of flap bearings I could have them overstress and break
But for wings themselves
I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd even calculate the stress they‚Äôre under
I guess the forces of drag on them
Bro how are they tied
Flap bearings are create contraptions
Wings work on normal contraptions as you know
Bro
:Gun_But_Better:
I disagree
Or ask the developer
:clueless:
I can implement it myself if I reaaally wanted to
I did
I said it wasn‚Äôt worthy of a ten minute timeout
But my message never sent
It was cringe yes
And if he does it again go ahead
Smh
We ain‚Äôt 1984
üíÄ
That was in aero
Null managed to get timed out in the main create
He said the beyond earth Dev was an abusive cuck
Which is true
He was
He doesn‚Äôt deserve a by name mention
Nono he‚Äôs like
Genuinely terrible
Exposed for stuff
Ad Astra is the devs of his team that left and made their own mod
Then he tried to sue them for ‚Äústealing his mod‚Äù when they rewrote it from scratch
He also did some suspicious stuff
what
The timeframe is gonna be dependent on lod which is out of my control and probably the addon api too
It will be soon
You‚Äôve been spreading the release window I jokingly dm‚Äôd to you so I‚Äôve been rolling with it but in actuality it could be faster or slower
I have no idea when lod is done
Yes
How the fuck do you stop a plane without friction
Tries to land on aircraft carrier
Launches into ocean
:clueless:
That‚Äôs not fun
I‚Äôm not releasing it before lod is done
That‚Äôs a final decision on my end
This is the part where he kills us
Fuck you all I‚Äôm Irish and Italian
Do you know how nationalities work
obviously uhh
dubples
Well my grandma lived in Ireland, my grandpa was born in Italy, my other grandma was born in Poland, and my other grandpa was also Italian
Okay waffleman
What
That explains a few things
Anyways dipshits I gotta go to class now
I feel like islands is really cool but basically impossible to run before multithreading arrives
Because it‚Äôs not the size of the islands it‚Äôs the sheer number of them
Well isn‚Äôt multithreading coming with lod anyways
Aero devs went full 1984
I swear I can‚Äôt type that year right
It eludes me
After certain recent events they‚Äôve been even more uptight and a few of their long standing members were caught in the crossfire
Lmfao
I‚Äôll be back
as the supreme 1984 of clockwork I say uhh
If B wins
I will delay mod by one minute
:trol:
Ah yes vote for my own poll
Genuinely don‚Äôt have anything to add I‚Äôve been trying to make a witty joke about this situation but it‚Äôs so dumb it has surgically removed my ability to understand humor
The trollage is funny but yall don‚Äôt need to keep butting heads like bulls in a pen
Ahah

:3drevenge: I can‚Äôt work on mekapi until Ruby finishes vsbodies
Soon
My main issue with boats is
The update will take longer
No you know what
Since it‚Äôs so close
I have a better idea than a poll..
A vote shall not suffice
Impromptu competition time motherfuckers
Exactly
It‚Äôs listed at the bottom of the message
#feature-requests with the Clockwork tag
Make sure to mark them as [A TEAM] or [B TEAM]
A is the first letter of the alphabet
So it comes first
:clueless:
I cannot participate
Since I am the organizer
Also
B for Bote
Yeah you have 3 categories to win in
Uh
Submarines would not be like
Part of this competition lmfao
They need a fluid sim
It is
Just don‚Äôt expect that if boats win
The reason cars were originally first was because they don‚Äôt rely on things as far off but ewou wanted boats first
that‚Äôs the whole reason I stated a vote
lmfao
Ewou make a fluid sim then
We don‚Äôt have that either
:clueless:
Okay while I do want cars first personally
Like bro
https://tenor.com/view/boat-boating-banshee-mercury-fast-gif-11351314
‚ÄúBoats slow‚Äù
Bruh
None of this fits with vanilla mc
We have a jet engine
Also yall do realize both updates will come out anyways right
This is a fight over who‚Äôs first
Not who gets added at all
Actually let me clarify
True
This is fun
The thing about boats is that they aren‚Äôt really that hard to build rn
Cars are more difficult
Land traversal
Who says a vehicle would
At the end of the day I‚Äôm making both
This is to see which side wants it more
So I can gauge what to make first
The power of a car is that you won‚Äôt face demise if you run out of fuel on the move
Airships dropping out of the sky will be GG when collision damage is added
Boats and cars are safer
That‚Äôs always been the crux
You‚Äôre operating under the assumption that suspension won‚Äôt be able to handle terrain
The land update is named Terrain and Tumble
For a reason
They won‚Äôt be counted
Suspension
When I feel like it
Aero isn‚Äôt the dictator of nothing
Well it‚Äôs not impossible to roll up a cube, especially when krunch doesn‚Äôt treat world cubes as perfectly angular objects
Wheel big :clueless: or jump it somehow
Suspension springs will be able to be wound up
And released
No
I have my own mental idea for how suspension will work
I mean
It‚Äôs not a legged jump
It‚Äôs more of a bounce
Because it‚Äôs badass
And as such any complaints of boats over cars and cars over boats is irrelevant when it comes to practicality
Though practicality is still present
Those are coming by default
As well as unpowered wheels for landing gear
And you can technically make boats already considering you have props (though they work differently in water
Wdym
All yall are so concerned about land and sea you have no idea about Continuum body slamming in with space /j
Teams united
You can‚Äôt download clockwork right now
It‚Äôs in development
Kotlin for forge
No you can‚Äôt
We‚Äôre done adding youtubers
Read the vs2 curseforge page
Depends
You‚Äôve been sufficient in breaking things so far
But I need more broken
I know there are bugs lurking somewhere
Just try anything
Oh trust me null is the best in the business with shattering things
I just said I‚Äôm not adding more right now
Smh
Reasons I am good at breaking things
I make clockwork
None of you can beat that level of breaking things
Sorry
1.19 wouldn‚Äôt be a major update
We don‚Äôt have to work on things monotonously
Like one to the next to the next
There‚Äôs a team for a reason
Well
No 0.1 is air
0.2 is currently having a duel for who will take its place
1.19 isn‚Äôt a hard port
Create multidevelops
I can too
No
Team C is continuum waiting in the background for Universal
:trol:
Physics engine
They don‚Äôt like it because they need someone to hate
Smh
Don‚Äôt listen to what he sus
He says
Thanks autocorrect
People can like whatever they want
We don‚Äôt gatekeep
Minor spelling mistake
Exactly
Chad
We do
The aero community is hell
I don‚Äôt mind the mod
Smh
It‚Äôs not a mod you can use
:clueless:
Get the Neanderthal /j
He‚Äôs memeing ewou
It‚Äôs chadism
You‚Äôre asking for troll logic you won‚Äôt receive my friend
I just realized there‚Äôs a
Sudden influx of people
I wonder if it‚Äôs a raid :Thonk:
Or just something happened
Did a youtuber upload or smthn
It‚Äôs hands on deck
Too serious imo
I mean the land update‚Äôs one is Terrain N‚Äô Tumble
Smh
It‚Äôs because fuzee
asterix and the magic potion
:clueless:
The vote isn‚Äôt accurate anymore
But either way
A team on top
bro you‚Äôre all thinking too small
A plane that airdrops a car that releases a boat that releases a submarine into the water that then builds a plane and launches it
The all terrain vehicle
Fun fact: afterblazers actually have a gimbal
It‚Äôs not accessible yet
But it‚Äôs fully setup
I just need to come up with a way to control it
Nuts deez nuts
Probably the remote thingy in the block
Set a signal to gimbal towards a given direction
But then you can‚Äôt really use signal strength
I mean ig you can but bleh
in 0.1.1
It has Redstone level but
Idk
That seems relatively sus
Also you can‚Äôt do a seperate value box on different sides I don‚Äôt think
They already do
Redstone links transfer analog signal
That wasn‚Äôt what I meant
Hmm
I wonder if it‚Äôd be better to have a controller block or something like create big cannons
The controller block youd stick on the back of it and power each of the four directions
Only issue then is that you might have some interference with changing the Redstone level of the burner itself
Unless I put yet another block between them but that‚Äôs overcomplicated
On another note
I doodled the little fella again along with some name ideas

Some of them are taken from people here or elsewhere
And others I came up with
Avitator
I am unsure what to name it
It does LMFAO
It‚Äôs not a bee
:3drevenge:
bruh
They have aviator goggles
No those be eyebrows
Floating ones
Rayman style
It‚Äôs a pun on Sputnik
Spud-nik
Cause potato
Hold on I must die for one hour
Decide while I am gone /j
Are you guys having a serious argument about why the thing *im* developing is a travesty if one funny set of features comes a month before another funny set of features
Like bruh I look away for 3 seconds
Not referring to at this minute
I meant to reply to the thing
People seem to disagree
Here‚Äôs the thing:
I would have more fun working on land
The reason I made it a vote is because ewou wanted me to do sea first
I wanted to see if that‚Äôs what people  wanted
Nah
Because I
Am the one devving it
And that‚Äôs a lot of work
Ah yeah lemme replicate
Not at all
Sails would use winds
They wouldn‚Äôt work at all like wings
No
That doesn‚Äôt work
Correct
clockworkj isnt out
i do not
He‚Äôs got a point
the takeoff one is called  abearing
:clueless:
no they do not lol
that wont work once lod
friction
ice is heavy as shit and also a square
you cant really get up hills with a square
kotlin for forge
#support Logs, modlist, error
which one
that is not your issue if you're
using latest all
because that is using vs2 beta 7
which is 3 versions out of date
üòÖ
Don‚Äôt forget the amogus role you need to get in there
Which you in turn need to get from #clockwork-furry-rpüîû
That only applies if you‚Äôre a dude to begin with
:clueless:
Bro I thought I was stupid but no
My Java class‚Äôs online ide is busted
I can‚Äôt iterate over an arraylist
Because it thinks everything in it is a generic Java object instead of the literal type parameter I set it as
:3drevenge:
And nothing will run for me (even if the grader can grade it correctly) because of unchecked or unsafe operations when I‚Äôm literally running a print statement
I have no idea
I can‚Äôt
It‚Äôs an online ide
Website essentially
It‚Äôs terrible
Grader
As in the like
Auto grader
Aight hold on
1.8.0_345
It‚Äôs not hyper ancient but it‚Äôs like old mc Java
It‚Äôs just a scuffed ide
It won‚Äôt let me do a lot of things you normally can
Not like my teacher reads it
It‚Äôs just an automatic grading system
If the code works as intended
Or does what it‚Äôs supposed to
You pass
You can cheese this by making about twenty statements for what the grader checks
LMFAO
I don‚Äôt though
Too much work
Nope
Not to my knowledge
It won‚Äôt run
Just doesn‚Äôt
I click the run button
It pauses
And then the run button turns green again
Never throws an error
Just doesn‚Äôt start
It is indeed
I wonder if I could just trick the grader into returning true always
:clueless:
Since it‚Äôs presumably written in Java
No but you can make something incredibly light
Like 1 gram
1.18 isn‚Äôt done yet
Api and vsbodies and the funny lod
There‚Äôs too much on the conveyor belt
To reliably port
Except alpha is clinically insane so he‚Äôs trying to port it already
datapack
I forgor exactly how
But he‚Äôs run into an issue
No but you can take a look at the vs2 GitHub to see how it does it
https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Valkyrien-Skies-2/blob/1.18.x/main/common/src/main/resources/data/valkyrienskies/vs_mass/wood.json
One day
üòî
being done is for cowards
Eternally soldier on
Don‚Äôt go quiet into that night
clockwork in 2025
If I‚Äôm still working on it then please assassinate me
Vtonl
3drevenge
Yes
1k
I spoke to dust yesterday night
He said he fixed it
Evidently that is untrue
He has a pretty based one
No it was just a coincidence, I forgot that server existed üíÄ
yes
Also I didn‚Äôt rename
I named
Bruh
No way
I still have mental damage from a screenshot calling clockwork a eureka addon
That‚Äôs crap
Cap*
I know they don‚Äôt because my family uses Apple products
Plenty of them
They suck total ass
At gaming
Well admittedly that‚Äôs because they can be designed to work with specific hardware
That‚Äôs the main benefit of macs
And Apple products in general
Smaller hardware pool
We aren‚Äôt arguing
I‚Äôm stating as an Apple user that Apple products are not good for gaming in most cases
But
Absolutely not
Bro idk what games you‚Äôre trying
Work well
Scrap mechanic doesn‚Äôt run
So
No I mean in general LMFAO
it just doesn‚Äôt run on any platform
Me when five fps collisions
>3080
It‚Äôs just multiplayer
Multiplayer in scrap mechanic sucks
But I don‚Äôt like single player
What‚Äôs the point of playing scrap mechanic singleplayer when I can go play bad piggies instead
:trol:
I have the pc port of bad piggies
I found it online
Along with a still working activation code
Yeah I know
I have a broken bad piggies cd
:clueless:
Speaking of bad piggies
While I‚Äôm typing I‚Äôm literally listening to
https://on.soundcloud.com/CWtnX7pHmNxLSJJw6
Wdym
3080
Scrap mechanic runs like shit in multiplayer
It just does
It uses a ratshit physics engine
They should just switch to krunch honestly :clueless:
What‚Äôs the point of a game with multiplayer if you can‚Äôt play multiplayer
No it just uses PhysX
Like 2001
That‚Äôs a visual bug
How do you even manage
Eureka and takeoff work fine
Takeoff just fights eureka because takeoff is outdated as shit
And has ancient eureka bugs
Create mastermind
He has early clockwork
Along with haz
@Dapheni
Does the sm64 mod work with vs2
I NEED to make compat if it doesn‚Äôt
We need to be able to BLJ off of a ship
There‚Äôs a sm64 in mc mod
And it NEEDS to be compat
I don‚Äôt care
Clockwork can wait if it isn‚Äôt
LMAO
I‚Äôm guessing Mario can‚Äôt collide with vs ships
Right
Like you just phase through them
Alright
That shouldn‚Äôt be a terribly difficult fix hopefully
I need to intercept how the sm64 mod sends its data to sm64lib
Yeah
It‚Äôs literally making two physics engines collaborate with mc as the bridge
Honestly maybe I should just make a pr for it
I don‚Äôt think I can mixin it
Not to the degree I need to
I do play mc occasionally
Yes I am the dev
I don‚Äôt play mc myself much tho LMAO
Non vs2 mc isn‚Äôt fun for me anymore
I do experiment building tho
Oh no
Gamers we have a problem
Retro64 bakes the world as sm64 terrain
I don‚Äôt think I can make that play nicely with vs2
At all
It‚Äôs gonna be forcing n64 terrain code
To move
Impossible with how this works
Hmm
It wouldn‚Äôt be impossible but
Mario is not gonna move smoothly on ships
You see
Since ships are on physics tick
And this generates surface terrain
On gametick
Wait actually is retro64 threaded
This would require a rewrite to retro64 probably
It uses its own way of generating collision surfaces
I have no idea how I‚Äôd hook vs2 in
Honestly I will contact them
Who are they anyways
Found the discord
Discord is small
I have a chance to contact this man
Here we go
Datapack
They didn‚Äôt break copyright
You need a Mario 64 rom to run the mod
I asked them to explain their voodoo magic
So I can combine it with vs2‚Äôs voodoo magic
Bing bing wahoo is dead
Walks
Linking libsm64 is the least helpful thing in the world
I know how retro64 works
I don‚Äôt know how they generate their terrain for collision
Because the variables are like proguarded I swear
There‚Äôs no way people work with 1-4 character variables only
I‚Äôve seen retro64 in action a lot
Walks you are impossible to talk to
Please read the conversation
Then come back
I know full well they‚Äôre open source
I just said
.
Not written ones
Just what I feel like
You‚Äôre gross
Walks
please
Read the conversation
it‚Äôs really, really not that hard
clockwork
I can say it smh
Depression
That was before rules change
:clueless:
Nah that isn‚Äôt hard
It‚Äôs just cubes with a width of 0
Flat faces
I use it in several places
On my models
Ye
It‚Äôs not bad at all
Texture could use some work
Well it‚Äôs
A rageface

Skill
Exactly so true
Just materialized Java knowledge
And yet while I can code an entire addon in a month
I still get 70s on my ap computer science exams
So like
Who‚Äôs laughing now
Probably not my gpa
:clueless:
Definitely not 1 week
My job takes up too much of my time for that lol
Alright so about the retro64 situation
Retro64 doesn‚Äôt support moving terrain
Pistons and falling sand and whatnot even
But it‚Äôs planned, just not implemented yet
So I may end up helping
Got something funny coming up for y‚Äôall to see
:trol:
No spoilers
NEVERMIND Ruby spoiled it
Yeah it feels lame
Go to the mods menu
On the main menu
Click mods
Click on a mod
Click config
ü§Ø
If you‚Äôre on fabric yes
If you‚Äôre on forge it‚Äôs built in
As fast as the game will let you
Create config menu isn‚Äôt even that good :clueless:
Not gpu
Mc doesn‚Äôt use gpu
It‚Äôs just automatic for every mod
Only works if you use their config system
Well it‚Äôs automatic
Common create L
Really what it should do is
Only add mods that have create config to the list
And not
Show every mod
With only like 2 working
Nah create‚Äôs config menu is using create‚Äôs config system
Completely custom config system
I‚Äôm not joking
Create doesn‚Äôt use built in anything
It‚Äôs annoying how they have seven hundred config base boilerplate classes
I couldn‚Äôt force it to cooperate with clockwork
Im off my shift and On my way home
Finally
Freedom from the wagie
I love waking up at 5 leaving at 6 and not getting home until 8pm
It‚Äôs great
:clueless:
The cycle of wagie
I feel like I missed some more
Lore*
What schematicsnnon comments
Trollage
I didn‚Äôt type redstone links
It was always contacts
https://tenor.com/view/1984-gif-19260546
what
contacts or links
I‚Äôve gone and confused myself now
Yeah? All the clockwork planes shown off so far have used them for control
There‚Äôs no difference
If it works ship to world it works ship to ship
It‚Äôs all just distance checks
The 3 main reasons
It‚Äôs good for physical locks
This means
Megazord real
#clockwork-üïö
Yes
Alpha is making it
I just look at my server list and I see


someone deployed a devious bot
just pinged me one thousand times in two seconds
:clueless:
I‚Äôm adding this to my collection
of pings
It just increased my total
I am the storm that is approachi
Would work so much better if weather2 compat pensive
Everything is right now
Krunch respecting block voxelshapes is coming with lod I think
It really wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to make pressure plates ‚Äúwork‚Äù with ships I don‚Äôt think
But it can‚Äôt be on a collision event
Cause that‚Äôs too laggy
It‚Äôd have to be using an aabb
You haven‚Äôt been finding many things I don‚Äôt already know about mr kneecap
The physics thread crashing doesn‚Äôt crash the game
By attaching Redstone to them
These are
Some of the worst things I‚Äôve ever seen
Good
I just want to staaart
#deleted-channel did a doodle in class
The issue is that create blocks don‚Äôt update on ships rn
They will once clockwork
Nobody‚Äôs getting the tester role
:clueless:
Surprise surprise but
I pick who I want
And who I trust
And also null
Some you‚Äôre *literally* a Dev
What
When did I say you weren‚Äôt
Yes but you can literally see #devchat
Use flaps on bearings for better control
:clueless:
Already one
It‚Äôs quality is getting worse
The more it‚Äôs reposted

It‚Äôs so crusty
It was already assembled, however, with the power of bluperglue and the exposed infuser ~~when I get around to finishing it~~, you‚Äôll be able to flash infuse something
I mean
It‚Äôs more about being able to grab physics objects
Nah the house implied home invasion
advanced edition
An infuser that only ever assembles things in front of it
And can‚Äôt be assembled itself
i decide when it releases :clueless:
*insert stone turning sound effect*
#eureka
its uncooked bread
raw
well when it was released it was rather broken
well no
not nearly as much
it still has some glaring exploits tho
because thats what the comment was about
.
right
i gotta do something in vs2 itself for triode
then i can work on a funny
because he asked me to do it
and i know contraptions goodly so i can get the info needed from them without making a mess
bro what the fuck is that plane design
LMFAO
what
but its so lazy bro
they didn't even replace planks with the fucking
frame block
:clueless:
Vs discord members when their dms to me about getting clockwork early access do not get them clockwork early access

the nut
Wait a second
Clockwork fixes them but
You know
Breaking them
Wings/flaps for drag
Or wait for clockwork and use reaction wheels
?
If you have wings at the edges and you try to flip the drag from the wings will resist it
Haz made a drone off that principle
@Haz
There‚Äôs a joke to be made here
But I‚Äôm not gonna make it so Ruby doesn‚Äôt kill me
Or you could wait like
*checks watch*
A few weeks
ü§®
You do realize that vs2 code doesn‚Äôt contain clockwork right
Clockwork is in a seperate repo‚Ä¶
The clockwork repo is not publicly available
And the only testers are null, fern, and outcraft
And they also don‚Äôt have repo access
The entire mod has been developed in the span of a month so far
That is record speed in development timeframes
No he‚Äôs just trying to ‚Äúleak‚Äù clockwork code by sending people vs2 code
lmfao
Vs2 is out
Clockwork ain‚Äôt
üíÄ
I still don‚Äôt know what it means
smh
boom
I didn‚Äôt get the role
:(
Air pocket detection moment
Valkyrien skies adds physics
Use latest vs2
Ah
I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm on phone getting ready for work
No they meant
Latest vs2

Clockwork
Probably not in the way you‚Äôre thinking
But yeah

Or takeoff
The fuck is that sticker
What did I just summon from the depths
I typed tournament and that replaced it
I meant to say Tournament or Takeoff
Who
Where did he say hash
I‚Äôm confused as hell
Bruh
He‚Äôs onto us
Bruh
Decrypt these buts
Nuts

2 hours left on my shift
Wasted my break for that disclaimer

One day
That‚Äôs gonna be a real jar
And y‚Äôall will be so used to it being a jpg
You‚Äôll miss it
Isn‚Äôt that one of shalz‚Äôs friends
Technically shalz is allowed to give him clockwork
Well not technically
He is allowed
Ea members are allowed to share the mod with friends
Testers aren‚Äôt
froge jar works better than bric jar rn tho
smh
bric for some reason renders command seat twice
and also makes the second render of it turn to face you
??
i have no fucking idea how
its gained sentience
i always knew it
the most advanced block in the mod got too advanced
@ewoudjeüöÄ
your chair gained sentience
have you not seen it
on fabric when you place the chair
it like
has a second render of it
that faces you
LMFAO
i have
but mine didn't
like
do that
on forge
its just bric
yes
you can kill create seats as well
you can kill any seat from any mod that has seats
you need an entity to sit on in mc
its dumb
you cant sit on a non entity i nmc
.exe
nutdealer.exe
why did i just open youtube and the first recommendation is a clickbait five nights at freddy's video
i was trying to get some gamer music for the coding grindset
and instead i got
fnaf 17 real not baitclick
what the fuck
is the music
i just hit play
only if you turn the distance in config up to like
30 billion
cause of a bug clockwork fixes
for now you have to set the link frequency off the ship
ctrl + middle click it
then place it on the ship
what
he's a tester
:diesofdeath:
theyve erased me
unperson'd
null is one of R&D's devs so he's like one of the 3 people i trust
well
no
i dont trust him
but he's close enough
they're in bad taste but like
i dont think you'll get obliterated
probably
üíÄ
pig event üíÄ
collision events suck ass
there will be a bad piggies easter egg in clockwork :clueless:
and also a few
borrowed
:clueless:
actually wait
i should post about plans
i havent done that in a while
i typically like to post about things once they're finished
but i will post a few things in the works
because why not
yes thats a known issue that clockwork fixes
you have to set them off the ship and then copy them onto it
using ctrl + middle click
soda pop rocket
:clueless:
no actually
my colors are hdr on my monitor
so i see
both images
its trippy

correct

funny soda
soda pop is either conk or bepis
you decide
there's another line of food related propulsion products to propel you past previous precognitions
:stratodonut:
frosting.
max size is 256 chunks x 256 chunks
theoretically
just don't make a ship larger than your render distance
for now
lod will fix that

biiig krunch changes
block properties, multithreading, shit like that
ventities arent in lod
no
just the soda pop rocket
no
lod is engine detail
not visual detail
like bounciness
and friction
and funny
br
.
ish
it doesnt really
tile entities dont render
ye
thats minimum compat
which is good
lmfao

nah nah nah
tnt that triggers off sudden velocity stops
i need impact tnt so people can make
soda missiles
idc
gonna throw myself off a bridge
just had 30 minutes of work thanos snapped
by intellij crashing
bro i changed so much
im gonna actually die
i have to remember what i changed now
:diesofdeath:
it didn't
for like 20 minutes for some reason
hold on go to clockwork chat rq
ooh
i like that design
me see funky compact-but-still-looks-good
me like
also me working on reaction wheels :trol:
they are going to be needlessly complex because i think its more fun that way :clueless:
statically fighting torque? hell naw
complex spinup and spindown math so they react properly? thats more like it
aesthetic > compact imo
but
i will never complain about both
more like a few weeks
we send them the mod in binary
obv
written on a scroll
which is escorted by an f22 raptor
by producing thrust
via propellors
etc
there is no wasd controller helm like eureka
rpm
they stole my fuckin magnet
gat damn
:3drevenge:
they dont got my absurdly complex integral tho so
cope and seethe honestly
touche
our magnets better anyways
cause we use magnetic field integrals
so like
ezdubs
doesnt have one torl
trol
we're gonna have actual magnets
and if anyone says we're copying
im sending them the takeoff mental breakdown
over magnets
cause #takeoff had a royal shitshow over accurate magnetic field calculations
im pretty sure its only magnets attracting magnets
nah its just a point magnet
takeoff's point magnets already work
honestly they probably work identically to aero's üíÄ
no like
code wise
not ponder
are they point magnets
or did you solve a funny integral
he dud
üíÄ
hat
what*
how salty?
oh right the cloud skipper
i forgot that was the name of the aero ship
cloud (word) isnt an aero trademark
ye but inherently it isnt
i was unaware it was üíÄ
wouldnt launch
ryan doesnt want them to
it hasnt really slowed down
i just have a job :clueless:
its not a passive gyro
a passive gyro is a Momentum Wheel, also known as a literal gyroscope
a reaction wheel is for turning
no
a reaction wheel is for turning a ship
we will
i have dust working as the ponder slav-
i mean
ponder healthily paid worker
the second mode of the reaction wheel is "manual", which lets you turn your ship using the reaction wheel
nah
though a youtuber showcase channel might be wise lol
to not clog #clockwork-üïö
@Rubydesic maybe you can throw that together
both of them apply a rotation
one just uses that rotation to cancel out rotations
the other lets you use it freely
its like
powering a thruster
in the direction you arent moving
will slow you down
but if you keep that thruster spinning
after you are already slowed
it will start moving you
in the other direction
a reaction wheel is essentially that but for rotation
wdym by eureka style
there is no eureka style anything
correct
Socket wrench is a multi tool in this case
You‚Äôd be able to enable conservation of momentum with scrolling
Or right click to vsify
Or 6
5 and 6 could honestly be a config option lol
‚ÄúConservation of Contraption Momentum Enabled By Default‚Äù
Config
Yeah, cause you‚Äôve essentially just made a shitty reaction wheel
Made of giant blocks of netherite
And a reaction wheel suddenly stopping produces a fuckload of torque
Well yes, but in a magic world where right clicking a bearing perfectly disassembles it instantly
It produces a shitload
Yes
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
Yes
They snap to the nearest position
of 4 directions
They will only disassemble near their start
What‚Äôs popping gamers
I see aero as the first message
I‚Äôm in for a treat aren‚Äôt I
Ah
I‚Äôm unsurprised that many people here are banned from aero smh
R&D will reacquire it when it undies after vsbodies
Bruh
Genius
Isn‚Äôt sombrero like 5
:clueless:
Or if you‚Äôre on crack cocaine
Go for takeoff
:clueless:
Correct
Either that or you have a shadow foyer
Typer*
How did typer turn to foyer
genius discord
It‚Äôs been done
Takeoff and eureka are enough
Can make a plane
Takeoff needs to get un-neglected
But I‚Äôm so busy with cockwork
And someone‚Äôs just making my potato battery mod but better
Takeoff was a tech mod built on vs2
It will not be overtaken by clockwork in scope
It had two whole library mods being written for it
yes
Tournament is adapting what it currently is
Since what it currently is won‚Äôt last much longer
Essentially
You know that mod
Tournament is better than adventure for takeoff
Clearly your stand is writing for you
And you‚Äôre just a brain in a jar
Your game said no proof
Yes
Vehicular manslaughter
As if I would buy anything made in France
Femboy legion
Also because aero shat on null repeatedly for its existence
240p
What  pitch
Plane pitch
Straight down into floor
Ohh that
Do team yellow and team purple
Cockwrok colors
Lmfao
Team brass and team ass
This is kinda like
The build battle coming up
But
Post release
Someone can want to be a femboy without wanting to be a girl smh
As neither boy or girl
I gotta hold out for the homies
Ya know
what is a potato
Yes
I am the indomitable human spirit in a potato
:clueless:
Well I think the tournament should
Wait for post release
As it‚Äôs about land vs sea
I mean that‚Äôs like 2 weeks Lol
But it‚Äôs more fun to say ‚Äúfuck it, survival‚Äù
Purple and yellow are literally complementary to eachother
Proguard trol
Yes
And we‚Äôll do it with vsbodies
:clueless:
Plane flies overhead, drops a crate
Crate breaks open on impact
Items
Cbc cannons aren‚Äôt worth the effort
Imo
If they aren‚Äôt an airdrop they aren‚Äôt getting used by me
Cause they‚Äôre just so impossible to use
And cost so much
They are
Me when my manually loaded cannon decides to misfire for no reason
Then when I reload it the exact same way
It fires
Or me when my cannon decides to have seven and a half miles of bullet deviation
Cannons are so inconsistent in their spread that it‚Äôs almost impossible to hit anyone
I mean
The architect didn‚Äôt
Build the ship
The engineer did
They may have thought up the initial concept
I‚Äôve driven the rest
I didn‚Äôt conceptualize clockwork
I just expanded on it as I went
It doesn‚Äôt really resemble it‚Äôs original plan very much
Wash I believe
I got hired because they knew I know create code
And
Because I was already an addon Dev
I commandeered it
Then I occasionally poke dust or somedom with a stick to get more models when I don‚Äôt feel like arting
And Ewou made the most complex feature out of nowhere
And then dipped for studies
So
Command Seat
Has a shitload of potential if you can scale the step easing learning curve
Because it‚Äôs literally like
Vertical
Well flap bearings
Also the expanded controller I still need to work on
But I haven‚Äôt had time
It has a throttle with control and shift for analog output and a lot more keybinds
It honestly wouldn‚Äôt be super hard to make
But it definitely seems like a Terrain and Tumble feature ngl
Pedal to the metal type deal
I don‚Äôt steal
*looks at soda rocket*
Most of the time
Mekapi
Trollage
Can‚Äôt wait until the clockwork 0.3 trailer when an R&D mech will make a guest star appearance
Quote me on that
It will happen
Yes

I will 100% have it show up out of fucking nowhere in a clockwork trailer
Before r&d itself even knows it‚Äôs done
LMAO
nah nah nah
I mean it‚Äôll ‚ÄúI am the storm that is approaching‚Äù some poor plane out of the sky
It weighs probably more than a 0.1.0 plane will be able to carry
You‚Äôll need an airship for it
Yes
IT GETS POON‚ÄôD

Spite
Spite
I can set it up for you
:clueless:
I‚Äôm on my phone
Not spite towards aero
Spite in general
I am fueled by pure spite
Unmoored
Uncaged
Downright unreasonable
Start?
I‚Äôve already been the bad guy :clueless:
I mean half the create community thinks I‚Äôm ‚ÄúThat asshole who makes clockwork‚Äù
LMAO
Smh
My entire life is not dedicated to hating aero
I don‚Äôt even hate aero
I have a distaste for their Dev‚Äôs practices
Soon ish
Well
Is it fine to say the aero community is hot trash
It‚Äôs like a fandom at this point
üò∞
Nah
The five year olds wouldn‚Äôt last a minute here
Their moms would pull they away from their computers at the amount of c*ockwork
Oh hey I can say cockwork without being banished to the shadow realm
:sus:
Don‚Äôt listen to delta
He‚Äôs our resident fabric shilling chat gpt
Are you using
1.optifine
2. Some mod that changes rendering
3. Not up-to-date vs2
No
It isn‚Äôt
1.18 better
1.16 vs2 is still in alpha
1.18 is in beta
They‚Äôre very much
Different versions lol
Cap
:E_sleepdeprived:
Well seven hundred core mods is excessive
But a core mod is fine
Also ironic they say that
Considering the average forge mod has about 16 dependencies
Admittedly create fabric feels like it has the entirety of curseforge as a dependency but that‚Äôs neither here nor there
>boots clockwork fabric in Dev
:clueless:
Eventually
When sub update
Fabric is efficient because it lacks the forge bloat
But then create is one of the only mods
That actually uses the fucking forge bloat
So they had to add it all back in
that‚Äôs why create fabric just
At least in my testing
If anything it runs *worse*
Porting lib obj is actually better than forge obj in 1.19
But in 1.18 it‚Äôs equivalent
A shitload of useless libraries
I don‚Äôt miss IE
Because even though I prefer forge I don‚Äôt use it
:clueless:
All of them.
I prefer forge because im a stickler who doesn‚Äôt like new things
LMFAO
and also because on my system fabric improvements to performance feel like hearsay
Didn‚Äôt someone make an elytra mod that changed it to use
Flight simulator controls
Wait but isn‚Äôt it client side only
Do a barrel roll is client side only
It‚Äôs okay who cares about elytra flight
You‚Äôll have planes soon
I should add a modifier to all the torque and force appliers for clockwork so they work scaled
So that wash won‚Äôt yell at me when his microblock plane flies at Mach 16
What
It‚Äôs custom made
It‚Äôs not kubejs
I don‚Äôt think anyways
Is it takeoff or tournament shitting the bed
Clockwork doesn‚Äôt typically freeze nearly as much as they do
I‚Äôm not sure why tbh
Eureka does it too sometimes
I feel like takeoff and tournament freeze stuff the most
Clockwork and eureka do the least
Maybe
I mean not eventually
It‚Äôs random
It‚Äôs not like a time limit
I recorded multiple hours of footage for a clockwork video i scrapped
And never froze once
What
No
You have them by default
lol
Testers
Nullshart, pastor of fern, and incraft
Are the only 3 testers
No you wouldn‚Äôt
ITs so CRUSTY NOW
it gets so much worse every passing dsy
I don‚Äôt know how
Because they‚Äôre beta testers
There are only 3 testers
And then a few youtubers with access
Can I be completely honest
I have no idea what sha512
LMFAO
Or where they got it
Someone spent 6 days trying to ‚Äúdecrypt sha512 for clockwork‚Äù
Then dm‚Äôd
To some people
Null included
The moment you ask to test clockwork you will never get to test clockwork
That is the rule
I choose who tests clockwork
I don‚Äôt choose people who ask me lol
It‚Äôs in the create config
I have no idea where
Also #deleted-channel back on the art grindset in class :clueless:
Why do you have to keep complaining about things every five seconds
Yes
My guy there is no prop meta
You‚Äôve deluded yourself
Can‚Äôt be 0
It‚Äôs 1000
That‚Äôs not maximally efficient though
None of your weird checkerboard bullshit propellors are meta at all
Lmfao
They‚Äôre an absolute waste of sails
Propellor sail count is barely a factor
It‚Äôs about wingspan
Making a checkerboard works worse than a prop a single block longer than that checkerboard
Like
Have you guys seriously not noticed that a prop with 8 sails, 2 length each blade, is exponentially stronger than
A prop with 4 sails
And continuing
üíÄ
The Idiot, my display plane has clown level weight distribution
It weighs a ton
And yet
It‚Äôs prop is a fraction of the size of your
‚Äú‚ÄùMeta‚Äù‚Äù props
And it still flies better
Than all of your meta planes
So like wtf are you doing
If my clown tier plane flies better than your ‚Äúel meta checkerboard‚Äù
Sylvia also doesn‚Äôt cause aero discourse every time they speak in general /j
T18 quad shitgine
Bro it‚Äôs actually horrific
This is not peak propellor design
This is insanity
Stacking them like this is diminishing returns level of efficiency
And it uses the fucking checkerboard
Perhaps but also null is just propelloring wrong
:braintoobig:
Shift starts in ten minutes and I won‚Äôt return until 9pm
Adios gamers
That‚Äôs what the clock is for
Oh wait a sec
I finished reaction wheels
That means
It is not within the week
No
It will release in February
That is a guarantee
I am setting that deadline on myself and myself alone
There‚Äôs no reason it would go beyond February
The final hours does mean something
Events are gonna come soon
Pre release events
Also wdym hyping the final hours I‚Äôve mentioned it like 5 times over the course of a month and a week
Smh
This month
February 2023
For real
Bruh
espionage
sabotage
thats because tournament fireworks are essentially just
thrusters
what is with you and using the fugly ass propellors
they already do
no
just a weird contraption
an odd doohickey
probably
its a little sus tho
also it doesnt really work like i wanted it to work when designing it lmfao
so i think ill end up splitting this reaction wheel and the simplified one i originally was aiming for
i guess ill make a momentum wheel for the other
or maybe i could use a flywheel as a momentum wheel
was about to say
issue is
the create flywheel is actually
a lie
:3drevenge:
it doesnt really preserve momentum
its all a visual effect
the reaction wheel
has actual momentum conservation
the create flywheel
just has a weird "visualspeed" variable
smhj
magnet plox
well how a reaction wheel works is
it only applies a torque as its speed changes
because conservation of momentum forces it to
256
it operates off create rpm
it just smoothly updates
like the propellors
actually i should copy paste the reaction wheel conservation of momentum math to propellors
:clueless:
Unless you‚Äôre mixining
You can only write mixins in Java
man really dm'd techtastic
smh
it is unlikely that it will cause pc explosion
even right now
no
it wont
but that would be funny
definitely not this week
waaay too much left to do
nah
not that many
i wish
i fixed like
LMFAO
example
LMFAO
there is no big explosion mod that actually uses
vanilla mc explosions
vanilla mc explosions are ass shit terrible
we arent talking about 1.5 mods here null
this aint hexxit
what
how
can someone test to confirm
wait a sec but clockwork's dogfight
we were able to shoot ships with the autocannon
and that was like
2 weeks ago
so it broke on their end...?
thats worrying
guh
hold on
im gonna send you a specific nightly
to make sure it isnt our end
cause if it is cbc's end
wtf did they change
no this isnt a compat thing this is sus
try this one

actually wait
before
you do
shoot it with a bow
the ship
does the arrow go through it
wait falls off?
uh
okay so it could be
that projectiles
are fucked
which would be bad
but try the nightly version i sent
if no change then projectiles fucked
goddamnit
what changed though?
how does that work
OHHHH
I SEEE HOW
there was an "optimization" patch
that changed how it detects whether its clipping
i think
and that caused this
https://github.com/rbasamoyai/CreateBigCannons/commit/b94f30e5efe1e8da8cc746472a368eed6ea1c61a#diff-2fe62e8dc27704b531ae38a690351c50f0dd458c8d053e92a112b35a0b5d6488
Aloha
Why did I just show up to a human trafficking scheme but with femboys
I am a janitor
Sweep sweep
Wdym
Just dm one of the janitors and they‚Äôll deal with it tbh
But tickets ig could work
it is lol
Allow me to demonstrate
Erased
:snap:

Man
That‚Äôs been his status for literally weeks
How have you not noticed
LMAO
I mean they didn‚Äôt solve an integral
They use a point magnet lol
Takeoff has point magnets
It‚Äôs had them for it‚Äôs entire existence
The whole point of the magnet integral was to make better magnets
And evidently from aero magnets auto align themselves, they didn‚Äôt solve it
(Point magnets are a single point so they will align themselves)
The magnet integral was to implement a magnetic field to a surface
Rather than a single point
Without having a billion point magnets
I mean it has no model file but go ahead
also they don‚Äôt save lol
They‚Äôre one of the two takeoff features that don‚Äôt save
Wings and magnets
Because both are broken :clueless:
Magnets work well but I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt save
And takeoff wings are just worse current wings
You can usually circumvent it by erasing the ships in a world but that‚Äôs not entirely optimal lol
Just wait for clockwork it‚Äôll have that integral magnet at some point :clueless:
Definitely not release 0.1 tho
Magnets seem like a terrain n‚Äô tumble feature :clueless:
Probably
Also magnets don‚Äôt work world to ship right now in takeoff
Or with any blocks other than more magnets lol
Clockwork ones will work a lot better whenever I get around to solving that field integral :clueless:
The plushie
I‚Äôm going to beat it up
:MENACING:
Murderable plushie
It‚Äôs dying
https://tenor.com/view/embed-fail-sonic-sonic-the-hedgehog-sonic-plush-gif-22419121
My embed fail failed
The prophecy
Oh there it goes
By making a vs addon
:clueless:
No
That won‚Äôt work lol
Already did
It‚Äôs almost like clockwork is a month old or something
:Thonk:
What did I come back to
>‚Äùobsidian is light‚Äù
It‚Äôs okay, when you make mekapi armor penetration mechanics you‚Äôll make obsidian act like glass
:clueless:
Security craft reinforced blocks are cheating to be honest
They make all blocks weigh the default weight
Because we haven‚Äôt configured reinforced blocks yet
There‚Äôs so many of them
Obsidian meta doesn‚Äôt work in vs2 because tnt cannons are 1. Not super viable and 2. Will launch your ship skybound
Explosives exert forces
If you have a blast resistant ship you will still be ragdolled
They didn‚Äôt hit you
The fire charge spam did
:clueless:
Fire charge meta real
I need to make wings flammable
No it didn‚Äôt
It made a spray of it but it took so long to detonate
That the big Bertha just
Flew through it
Without caring
That wasn‚Äôt from tnt
That was from the fire charges
Cause their entire ship was wool
Lmfao
Also
Makeshift and flamethrower in the same sentence
Tends to have consequences
Hence why after the dogfight our firecharge spammers
Decided to
Unalive themselves
They burnt cause we made the flamethrower out of wool
:clueless:
Yes but they‚Äôre lame
Also securitycraft in general is lame nowadays
The new cameras suck :3drevenge:
I‚Äôll make a camera mod using immersive portals-like rendering :clueless:
Valkyrien Espionage when
Yes
That‚Äôs how the original securitycraft cameras worked
You do realize that vs ships are projections
vs ships are projections of blocks ten billion blocks out
They are already immersive portals type rendering
I‚Äôd be using Vs2‚Äôs chunk rendering trol
So
Ratio‚Äôd honestly
Only issue is I have no idea how I‚Äôd do that
And also I don‚Äôt have time
:clueless:
hmm i wonder if there‚Äôs a mod that just so happens to be very good at optimally loading far away chunks for visual purposes or something
Oh and on that maybe it should also add like
And while they‚Äôre at it
Physics
I think it should be called Valkyrien grounds
:clueless:
But yeah ignoring my biting sarcasm a camera mod would be useful for a number of reasons
I‚Äôm just too busy with way too much other stuff
I was being sarcastic
This is a mod that fits that description
Space engineers physics suck
:clueless:
Lightly taps floor
Entire ship implodes
?
They disabled water rendering partially in a closed room
Vs1 did that
Vs2 plans to have a more complicated solution
Bro wtf
Did you shit in the sink
Bro stop touching the literal biohazard
Your water is contaminated
Like actually call a plumber
THE FOG
THE FOG IS COMING
But they said only white goo
Not the goo water
:goosemath:
I can‚Äôt read that
What mods do you have
Structurize isn‚Äôt compatible
It‚Äôs listed in the incompatible mod list
#wiki-updates
https://wiki.valkyrienskies.org/w/index.php?title=Compatibility%20list/1.18

Low priority
Fixing minecolonies is Herculean and not our problem :clueless:
Don‚Äôt
It‚Äôs incompatible with almost as much as optifine is
Bro it‚Äôs a raspberry pi
Bro how much cooling do you need it‚Äôs a fucking raspberry pi
That thing would run if you had a desk fan pointed at it
üíÄ
:trol:
Nah
It‚Äôs overclocked to high hell
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so worried about heat efficiency, so I overclocked my raspberry pi to 2.5ghz‚Äù
Real men use lung cooling
Nah the joke was that you evidently aren‚Äôt looking for reason at this point
LMAO
Yes
I run my computer on a foot pedal bellow
hmm
I have a lot to do I just don‚Äôt know what to pick
Gotta scroll through my list
Could work on balloons but i don‚Äôt want to be the one to make balloon detection code because knowing me if I do it, it‚Äôll be the most scuffed bullshit ever conceived
I think instead Imma work on the liquid fuel system :clueless:
No :3drevenge:
No soul cum
That‚Äôs technomancy‚Äôs thing
:clueless:
Don‚Äôt ask
It‚Äôs an in-joke
For some reason create addons like to add
Kick it
It‚Äôs the final hours
Not the final hour
(Fucking in the night)
Why though
Because it‚Äôs a discord
And people can talk about things in other channels
Accidentally waved to someone smh
what
The infuser
It‚Äôs a block because it is one
Why would it be an item
Is your create bearing an item or a block
A free spin bearing is just a word aero came up with for ‚Äúbearing with physics‚Äù
And yes
Smh
Then
They emerge into my dms
And ask for clockwork
‚ÄúI has two subscriber on YouTube‚Äù
‚ÄúPls mod‚Äù
Or worse people asking for beta testers like
‚ÄúI can break the mod‚Äù
No shit
Everyone can break the mod
It‚Äôs in beta
Should I be hired as a security guard because I can break someone‚Äôs knees with a baton
No
Mostly due to the create community
Clockwork is a double edged sword
A seven year old army but at what cost
Child soldier charges probably
Actually
Fern and Outcraft are working on a chat gpt ai
Trained specifically to respond to vs questions
No matter how poorly worded
It‚Äôs had a few
I mean clearly it should be considered a warcrime

I mean out of fern‚Äôs forays into ai
This one is the most sane
His last one had a penchant for threatening my life specifically



It was trained off r&d‚Äôs user base so it was
That was because it was mid
Broken
It was being forced to sing never gonna give you up and got stuck in a loop
That was the only coherent response I could get out of it
Clearly it is sentient
I have wagie job today
But I will try to crank progress out in the short between time
Nah it‚Äôs minimum wage
But minimum wage is surprisingly not bad
I wanna work on ponders tbh
Probably should soon
Once I finish content
I already have a ponder monkey
That being dust
I give him banana and he make ponder gallery world
Preferably
We‚Äôd have a ponder for every item
At least ones that need it
Yeah some items will have multiple ponder pages
Hmm
Well ponders are really just schematics with extra steps
And some code
I mean realistically we don‚Äôt have a ton of crazy mechanical stuff yet
It still needs a lot more work
And a lot more features
Before I consider it ready to release
There are quite a few
But I can crank out a few more
At least for version 0.1
Gotta be a big drop
Plus we need more cosmetic features rn we‚Äôre hyper utilitarian lol
Which isn‚Äôt bad technically but cosmetic features people tend to enjoy
Plus with my texturing I can probably make some half decent building blocks at least
Okay so due to complications with stuff my shift got changed today
Therefore
I am off work
It‚Äôs time to clockwork
Reaction wheel can be used for compact steering in general
That‚Äôs it‚Äôs purpose
I had like 4 pings
What did I miss
50 gigabyte log file
any change in speed
they work like an actual reaction wheel
no
it doesnt
exact opposite
reaction wheels use a change in velocity to apply a torque
a momentum wheel/gyroscope uses a constant velocity to keep stabilization
lmfao
i was about to say
its not rocket science
but no it
well kinda
they're both wheels that spin to cause a torque
the difference is how they're used
and typically the scale
a momentum wheel is just a fancy name for a gyroscope
a reaction wheel is the opposite of a gyroscope in that it intends to apply a torque rather than resist it
using the same principles that makes a gyroscope work
correct
well i want the flywheel to also work kinda like a momentum wheel albeit a simplified one
the reaction wheel is the pro gamer strat multitool one
and the flywheel is "spin me to not spin yourself" kinda deal
reaction wheels are more useful for drones since on-a-dime turning is nice
well the propellor bearing actually
will produce gyroscopic force
like the reaction wheel
the reaction wheel is the propellor bearing's little brother
well
you can have a propellor bearing suspended above another
and then invert their blade direction
so you could have that one spin opposite
too annoying
would have to work around contraptions in the way
propellor blades have a default and it cant be changed
essentially
they dont literally have a number, but how their math works is that it treats it as if they did have a number
weird to explain it like that
but
propellors use create sails
not vs wings
ngl i can barely comprehend the propellor math, it's 90% triode black magic so
imma say no
its possible just not in the way you're thinking
fair
but the need for one makes it realistic :clueless:
but you should be able to circumvent it
with contra rotating props
well for normal helis
no
sounds like something thatll be fixed in
0.1.1
aka funny big airship sub-update
ye the afterblazers are the tiny jet engine
like how 0.1 will only have the tiny balloon burner
the big multiblock balloon burner, its jet engine counterpart, and a few other big ship specific things will come in 0.1.1
including the reverse of the combustion engine
a *big* SU producer
for a *big* ship
but more on that later
the combustion engine rn is essentially our tiny power plant
thats the inverse
i mean the reverse of its purpose
also
the combustion engine doesnt use coal
when was the last time you saw a coal powered combustion engine??
liquid fuel
:clueless:
the mega engine concept i have is something im keeping as a trade secret to myself
its in my insane ramblings google doc
soon
full of clockwork ideas
no
its mine
only i get to see what i type when im off my meds
for now
btw
low res one
üíÄ
you're getting a lot more than just big jets
but thats enough hyping up the second release
as for the first release
it approaches
yes
its a mess tho i live in fear of that repo
takeoff had magnets first
:clueless:
they're point magnets
same as takeoff ones
except dipole
thats why they auto align themselves
people making eurekacars real
damn
i saw a eureka car the other day tho
was this massive fuckin thing
The weighted shaft I think kinda does that
I don‚Äôt remember to be honest
It‚Äôs not implemented yet skull
Well the world‚Äôs collisions aren‚Äôt perfectly cubic
There‚Äôs some roll to them
As you can tell by ships being able to roll
Free spin bearing is a word aero made up to sound cooler than ‚Äúbearing with physics
Yes clockwork will have one
?
What do vs bodies have to do there
Vsbodies aren‚Äôt blocks
well yeah but I mean vsbodies are non block-grid related
That‚Äôll be when Krunch supports the block‚Äôs actual voxelshape
And not just cube
Official clockwork server might have to wait a bit
I did get partnered with bisect but the partner server is a little bit weak
Well we have an affiliate link now
bisecthosting.com/clockwork :trol:
I‚Äôm unsure if that‚Äôs how you access it
Hold on
Lemme see the exact link
uhh I‚Äôll check in a bit
Needs excessively large amounts of ram
:clueless:
Cpu good tho
Yes
I will crowdfund an overkill server if I have to
Through the power of shilling my commissions
:clueless:
Well I also have a job
I can pay for a good server
No lame
I am still underage and still in high school there is *nothing* else I am using that money for my compadre

Smh

Oof I feel that one
trust me my work ethic is the only thing keeping me alive

So Spanish is completely impossible for me
Because I keep interjecting Italian instead
Bro you have no idea how many points I‚Äôve gotten off
For writing bien
That‚Äôs a eureka thing
No other addon has fast turning for large ships
Eureka just has the same speed for all ships
I mean
Clockwork doesn‚Äôt have wasd control
Clockwork is ‚Äúgood fucking luck‚Äù
You mean r&d?

The r&d mech
Funny create mech mod
The official clockwork server will have to wait but I can use its husk as a training ground in the meantime
the official clockwork server will have a curated modpack, excessive amounts of custom textures and GUIs, and a shitload of kubejs tomfoolery
It‚Äôll be like above and beyond but for vs2
I doubt it‚Äôll be anything like tavernn
Tavernn is also run by buni and I don‚Äôt have fear in saying buni is seventeen feet up his own ass, which is impressive because he‚Äôs only 3 feet tall to speak of
Klarkson leaks into the clockwork side of things
Like a fucking plague

I need to update the stickers with his new model ngl
What if I have klarkson be the tutorial guide in the clockwork server :clueless:

then he walks you through a private spawn

Copper is extremely heavy
Waaay heavier than the default weight
For some reason oxidized copper is heavier
You know I can just
Just checked
They both have the same mass
Because neither has a set mass
:clueless:
Clockwork has a set mass for copper
Correct
No it just should be in base vs2
I was unaware it wasn‚Äôt
Gotta love the gravitron physics
Can‚Äôt wait for api so gravity guns can use force appliers instead üòÖ
Or even like
The ability to update constraints
That would be nice
Rn the gravitron has to delete and recreate them constantly
üíÄ
I mean
Create is somewhat compatible in base vs2
But a few youtubers also have clockwork
So it depends
It‚Äôs not vanilla
It‚Äôs a modded server with a vanilla client
It can‚Äôt
It‚Äôs a display entity
Armor stand hell still scares me
I am home
Today is a no code day
For what purpose
Bro what kinda motherboard
fluid sims
:clueless:
download more ram
yes
thats just eureka
because they dont have a full block hitbox
so you arent technically on the ground
its a known bug
you cant crouch walk on vs2 shipified blocks
with some weird exceptions
because krunch is already better than its competitor engines /j
:clueless:
yes
but they dont stabilize anything yet if constantly spinning
they only apply a torque when their speed is changed
definitely not never
its a matter of whenever we figure out dynamic connectivity
smh
you know something funny about that
copilot is starting to understand the vs codebase
me and triode were coding a bit ago
and at first copilot suggestions were
worthless
but then it started guessing his instructions to me
before he finished saying them
na bro i mean copilot was literally doing some of the math for me
and correctly too
it was kinda freaky
i mean
bounciness
is
a lod thing
and coming soonish
whenever triode finishes lodding
no i dont trust it
i appreciate when it types something i was already about to type
hes running that pentium -2
mans computer cant even krunch
guh

it will be soon

sundial moment
official clockwork server
ü§Ø
I can barter with bisect for a better server once clockwork drops and starts raking in downloads ez
But for now it‚Äôs definitely not a bad host at all
Plus it‚Äôs free
Who cares about specs, it‚Äôs more than enough to keep tps at acceptable highs
Yes
It is but hey
Free is free
plus they‚Äôre the second least scummy server host
Ye
Bro üíÄ
Bro if I want absolute reliability
I have a computer downstairs in my basement
Stronger than your server
I could kick that old shit brick on and host using it
Not that anyone would ever want to play something off my internet but
I have enough faith in the partner server that it‚Äôll keep 20tps stable
It‚Äôs a forge server lol
There is no such thing
As stable worldgen
On forge
what did he even like say just there
Bro he did not
-2 tps
Reverse the flow of time
Nah that‚Äôs c2me
C2me doesn‚Äôt work with vs2
Remove the shroud I beg you
The clipping
:diesofdeath:
Also if you think that‚Äôs overkill you clearly don‚Äôt have excessive amounts of ksp playtime clueless
Oi null
:Gun_But_Better:
Ea players get builds when we feel they‚Äôre stable enough to not cause immediate death
Smh
I will make reaction wheels work fully today and then I‚Äôll give ea members a new build
I need to figure out how to have them sap angular momentum from ships when spinning at a constant speed
Reaction wheels in clockwork
Or that
Well
Then the answer is no rn
Thing is that even if you have a hinge and it‚Äôs spinning really fast
But the issue is
Hinges only apply torque parallel to the ship they‚Äôre attached to
Not perpendicular
So it‚Äôs not possible to make a hinge gyroscope
Yea
Especially a fast spinning one
No we mean The Kraken
As in
The almighty kraken
It probably incurred the kraken itself if it had a lot of bearings
A vessel
For the beast
But no spazzing out
Not really the kraken
A ship based chunkloader was considered for clockwork
But like
If you accidentally let your plane go
And it flies into the sunset forever
Commands + api + lod
Clockwork needs them to be truly based
What‚Äôs the point of chunkloading ships then
If you want it to stop when a player is out of distance
Why do y‚Äôall keep making such
Arbitrary release dates
Ah yes clockwork release on the fifth millisecond of the sixteenth second of the fortieth minute of the thirteenth hour of the Wednesday after next
and no sooner or later
Or some bullshit like that
I don‚Äôt even know when clockwork will release
I just know it will be before the end of February
No I‚Äôm saying that because I won‚Äôt let myself be off by a month :clueless:
There‚Äôs a lot of polish left to do but content wise
Don‚Äôt need to have absolutely everything on release 0.1
0.1.1 will catch its slack if necessary
Kinda sorta yes
Flying machines
The bane of vs2
Go ahead
What
Hmm
I think I get what you mean
1.19 is planned yes
:goosemath:
Clockwork won‚Äôt be 1.19 until vs2 is
Soonish
Within this month for clockwork
For 1.19 whenever alpha isn‚Äôt busy
~~Though clockwork may be held up if lod or the api are held up~~
Fair
Base vs2 will be updated soonish
What
So the (admittedly pretty) decorative block mod can get 200k
I‚Äôm not gonna lie the monorail is just an upside down train
That‚Äôs just linking two trains together with the chain thing
I mean useful features yes but it still is a very hollow addon imo
Correct
When have I argued that
Unsure if they will
I think trains will be a full update for clockwork
There‚Äôs a lot we can do with them
At the very least trains will get their own dedicated sub-update
If not a full 0.4 or whatever
They will probably have aero before clockwork reaches 0.2/3/4
You overestimate my speed
They don‚Äôt have a dev version of aero
At least to my knowledge
Could be wrong
Also I have no idea if they do because supposedly we‚Äôve only seen 0.01% of aero publicly
Oi
No Ryan shitting
Yeah
I respect your opinion and have my own stance but we really don‚Äôt wanna just shit on people in general
You can talk about them
Idc
Just don‚Äôt go after their throat

gotta love mc
you're spoiled from c2me

it can load like
thousands of chunks
at a time
probably when vs3
sundial
who would do such a thing
:clueless:
phixed
i didnt make it
fluffy did
Constraints will be a lot more stable once triode finishes perfect rigid ones
But they‚Äôre waiting on vsbodies
As are 90% of krunch changes
I rise from the ashes
For real this time
It‚Äôs time to get clockworkin
yes
I have a question for you gamers
Call upon the kraken
I feel like if I apply it at the center it could cause some oddities
yeah so I‚Äôll try volume
Smh
Dynamic connectivity when
Actually those are the same aren‚Äôt they
:3drevenge:
I‚Äôm not doing floodfills because create already makes the game run like shit
Can‚Äôt afford to make it shitter
Especially since while there is a max balloon size it‚Äôs still not that small
You‚Äôd need to be clinically insane
The minimum size for a balloon would be a 3x3x3 cube
With a single hollow center block
So you‚Äôd have a hundred of those
Well if the force is only applied at the center of the balloon
What about a balloon shaped weirdly
Not really
I‚Äôm 99% sure that would make a lot of ships also tip the fuck over
Blimps are not good war machines
But blimps in 0.1.0 won‚Äôt be for warfare
They‚Äôre sustainable and stable
Yes
Unlike its big brother in 0.1.1
The scalable balloon burner will not be so generous with its fuel efficiency
Fluffy had the idea for a contact probe
Yes
That‚Äôs the contact probe
It reaches out 15~ish blocks to the ground and outputs a matching redstone signal
It literally probes for the ground
Ropes will be in clockwork once vsbodies are done
I‚Äôll have a physics rope pulley cranked out ez then
But not rn
Tournament ropes aren‚Äôt ropes
Tournament uses a rope constraint which is more of a straight line
uhhh
that one thing i dm'd you about a while ago will have cooling
but the combustion engine (small) is meant to be like

Holding myself to that one
Very true
But I‚Äôve come this far in a month
I can‚Äôt trip now
Bro I‚Äôm gonna be using February break to code lol
Ain‚Äôt no way in hell I‚Äôm releasing it before then

Alright so
They also don‚Äôt support more than one burner since- thats not the point of the Ballooner
Balloons actually have bastardized drag (because without drag balloons will bob up and down eternally)
Yes
OH I SHOULD ADD POPPING TO THE BALLOON CASINGS

The ballooner‚Äôs throttle is controlled with an rpm input on the bottom, and you can input fuel on its horizontal sides

My issue with people complaining about cancel culture nowadays is
Cancel culture has lost all of its power
Because Twitter users have lost all of their already almost nonexistent respect from the world
nobody cares about who‚Äôs trending on Twitter anymore
Because one is for forge and one is for fabric
It really can‚Äôt do anything good
You don‚Äôt deal with a serious issue by cancelling them on Twitter
lmfao
Obv not
Typically innocent people don‚Äôt get actually cancelled but they get attempts
Especially when the attempts are blatantly bullshit
Or based on something completely asinine

You don‚Äôt even have EA smh my head
Bro
I have a montage of you spamming my dms
The balloons aren‚Äôt poppable yet
They will be
Even though they have properties of bamboo
Also you don‚Äôt need to use balloon casings btw
Do you not understand why create is laggy
Everything is a tile entity
Shafts are tile entities
This is another to the pile
Yes you can
4096 volume by default, configurable
That‚Äôs a max of a 16x16x16 internal volume for a balloon
Yes but only when it absolutely needs to
I tried to make it efficient
Oh you think that‚Äôs bad
I gotta figure out fluid holding
Which does have an architectury api for it
SO IT DOESNT WORK

You would need an ai designed to think

Wings have a cambered value, aka an angle of attack
Consider them always angled up
Flaps do not
They‚Äôre just a flat wing
Essentially even if your plane is perfectly level
Cambered wings will be angled up 10*
No because these don‚Äôt function like real cambered wings, they aren‚Äôt directional beyond having an up and down lol
Probably
That reminds me
I need to break the cursed propellor meta
The ugly ass checkerboard and vertically stacked props
Yes
There‚Äôs a workaround for it right now I need to patch
If you make your prop a checkerboard
For some reason
It just acts like it‚Äôs balanced
:clueless:
Well not like full checker
Cringe
Also the multiple blades stacked vertically is dumb lol
I need to patch that too
No I mean
People doing like
+ on top of another +
To acquire a second propellor on one bearing
Too bad, not intended behavior so not remaining
Rango suggested an octagonal
Propellor
To have 8 blades
Or 3
Or any combo really
But would be weird
To like program lol
I‚Äôd have to make diagonal blocks
And that‚Äôs ???
What
We‚Äôre talking about propellors
Real chads only use flaps
Since wings will make you pull up
No matter what
But flaps also don‚Äôt provide lift if perfectly straight
So it‚Äôs a risk
How the hell did people get next year from ‚Äúby the end of the month‚Äù

NEW TACTICS
NEW TACTICS PEOPLE
February break is approaching.
I‚Äôll be off for an *entire week.*
President‚Äôs week
American holiday
ü¶Ö
Yes
No
What
Spring break is Easter
:E_clown:
President;s day
Is a full week off here
:Troll:
Ratio‚Äôs
Clockwork when Continuum
I mean uh
Nothing
Ignore the third word in that message
Its been taken down
What
Whitelist?
It‚Äôs not real clockwork
Real clockwork is 972mb :Troll:
If it was releasing this week I‚Äôd have a date posted skull
Man
A whole month and a half
ü§®
No one acted sus to your little sister
You banned me for, and I quote, being a capitalist
üíÄ
You did infact ban us for that
?
I didn‚Äôt borrow anything
Null doesn‚Äôt even get credit for being the bad guy
Not magma
:diesofdeath:
Use arclight
Arclight
not magma
lmfao
I said by the end of February it‚Äôd be done
it will probably release whenever lod is done
As is clockwork
ü§®
We will also have some pre release events anyways so that might push it back so we have time to actually host them
lol
But as I said
Mod content and polish should be complete by end of February
Will it actually release then? If lod is ready, yes
Else, like a little longer
Can never have enough testing
That‚Äôs why we have a squadron of testers now
10 of em
Got home
Light speed is because of the same bug that null experiences
Drag and shit being mega fucked
They were never broken
They just don‚Äôt render sometimes
Lol
It‚Äôs circumstantial
Since they‚Äôre transparent blocks technically
It‚Äôs not something I can fix until I replace the 2d lighting with 3d
The infuser is probably the most complex block partial block in a create addon which is kinda sad cause it‚Äôs not that complex
Stop makin me hungry bro
:3drevenge:

Accidentally logs his keys and sends them to you
:clueless:

You don‚Äôt understand
It was an epic journey
It was not simply golf
@YAROBONZ @MrWaffle @INGSOC and @CBGamer20 spent 2 hours
On an epic quest
Of teamwork
Cooperation
And betrayal
It‚Äôs not about beating
They worked together to get a 5 way tie
LMFAO
My friends and I found a stupid inspirational quote not generator and

Thanks, inspirabot
I couldn‚Äôt make lod if I wanted to
Smh
I‚Äôm not a dude
How can I be a femboy
Wait a minute siepert
You timed him out for liking vs2
But you like vs2
üíÄ
@Siepert
But what if vs better
:clueless:
Admittedly yaro has actually tried clockwork
Ye but he only has a reference point for one
Don‚Äôt invite anyone to that cesspit
üíÄ
I‚Äôm gonna do it
You motherfucker
Subscribble to me on toubyue for uh
https://tenor.com/view/impeachment-love-democracy-i-love-democracy-gif-15723806
Mature and reasonable?
On the vs discord!
Bro you lookin for maturity
You should not be here
There was a guy trying to decrypt sha512
And another who thinks he made an ai that can feel
Gran yaro is doing something called trolling and you are doing something called feeding the troll
Bro what are you trying to accomplish
I‚Äôm not sure how you expect complaining in general to fix that
^
Honestly? Average mac user moment
Bro you are way overshooting the problem
All he‚Äôs saying is average mac user moment
It‚Äôs a four word phrase
No don‚Äôt go on rust
I‚Äôm in Minecraft‚Äôs discord
No idea it was full

This is actually in the mc discord as a sticker
Sad yeeted


Uhhh
I did in clockwork
But I used create‚Äôs tag registry
So idk
One more class and then I‚Äôm on my way home
And I will get something done today smh
Apple‚Äôs ecosystem isn‚Äôt actually that bad it‚Äôs just run by a money hungry company üòÖ
Actually my family has a big ol iMac from 2012
It outlasted my old windows pc by years
If you can have a computer still running perfectly after nearing 11 years of heavy usage and abuse
It‚Äôs good enough for me
It‚Äôs my dad‚Äôs main work computer
We have had to wipe it once though because my dumbass installed a virus
üíÄ
When I was younger
1. ?
Only valid point is 4
The only real point against apple products is the company that makes them
If apple wasn‚Äôt scummy
Their stuff would be way better
I don‚Äôt remember but it was a program that I installed on accident through adfly cause I was like 8
That‚Äôs still company that makes them
??? No you don‚Äôt
It can actually
More than linux anyways :Troll:
As I said
The only point against apple products is apple themselves
I mean I‚Äôm typing this on an apple phone :Troll:
I enjoy the battery life that I don‚Äôt need to charge for 3 days even though I know that won‚Äôt last much longer (phones getting old)
üéä
Guys very important

Look at my dog
LMFAO
So fitting for the bing ai to be unhinged
Bing is just unhinged Google
Bro it‚Äôs literally fern ai hold on
How long before this
Bro it is
Bing ai is the overlord
Give it to Boston dynamics.
Just put it in atlas
And watch the chaos
Put the mentally unstable ai in the world‚Äôs most advanced and mobile walker robot
I‚Äôm sure nothing will go wrong by giving it hardcore parkour skills
Pinned a message.
It‚Äôs already pinned
Now it‚Äôs pinned twice
Incorrect it was not a golf challenge they beat me in
It was a test of teamwork
You see
I got 4 idiots to cooperate enough to acquire a three way tie
In a game of putt party
And not like a ‚Äúwe all have 10 par‚Äù
The winners all had -3 par
Pinned a message.
Yes
No
Soon üòî
I‚Äôve been setting really close deadlines for myself
But really release won‚Äôt happen until lod is done
Which could be on time
Or it might cause a delay
A lot
Block properties (friction, bounciness, etc), compound collision shapes, multithreading
It‚Äôs as clean as any code based on create gets :E_imatmylimit:
Planned
by tech
:clueless:
ReCreate is an actual project
That is actually being worked on
By tech
And me eventually
Yes. It‚Äôs horrific
Create code is a sin
It will open after release 0.1.1
Not first release
Need more time to make it not fugly
Fucking + ugly
It‚Äôs as clean as I can get it while basing it off create code and moving at the speed of 1 mod per 2 month
:clueless:
Mods typically take a very

You see
There are instances where you want parts of a ship to rotate
But you don‚Äôt want that rotating part
To be it‚Äôs own ship
Like create contraptions colliding with the world and other ships but not the ship they‚Äôre a part of
So
It‚Äôs just two seperate collision shapes
As one
Hence compound
Maybe.
We haven‚Äôt decided
The current contraption system is pretty much unusable
Well issue about that
Tech wants to give recreate to the create devs.
If we base it on vs2 and they accept
Aero will have a fucking meltdown
which would be funny
But also problematic
For some reason
Create devs actually have spoken with Ruby about using vs‚Äôs system for contraptions
And they showed interest
Not necessarily using vs itself
Just vs‚Äôs like handling of objects
Essentially making contraptions not entities
Yeah
That‚Äôs not- news
That was something stated before clockwork even began?
It automatically restarts around this time
I wake up at 5 smh
That speech bubble
üíÄ
You could have at least centered it
Add it to the pile
Don‚Äôt remind me
Gore
Banned
The duality of ai detection
Somehow saying ‚ÄúI woke up and chose violence‚Äù is higher rated than
Level of whatever its accusing of
I have no idea how ION managed to say that without it being a 9 since saying cockwork almost always nets a 9
What the fuck
How did I get a higher rating
No but
It knows how to distinguish types
:menacing:
Not flagged
Ai didn‚Äôt detect the recipe for napalm
Why are you so hung up on that
???
It‚Äôs a bot that flags messages tf is your issue
It never does
It‚Äôs just a rating to point it out to us
I‚Äôm seriously confused as to why null cannot give up the fact that there‚Äôs a rating on all the cock jokes you make
They aren‚Äôt even that funny üíÄ
Because dimension rendering changes
It‚Äôs also why immersive portals on forge died for a while
Supposedly though it‚Äôs possible
It wouldn‚Äôt be compatible with vs2 at all unless it was made using vs2 or with vs2 in mind
No it relied on forge bloat that got cut out
And that fabric kept
I‚Äôve considered adding that to my list of projects (mostly since cameras would be very useful for some mekapi vehicles)
I might
It depends on the demand for it
Of course I could always just include it in mekapi but :clueless:
Minema
use minema
Replay mod fabric is a travesty
?
Minema resurrected
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minema-resurrection
Should work
It can record the game at slower speeds and then play it back full speed
No
:3drevenge:
Clockwork
I have off the entire next week
:Troll:
üòî
Even if I could physically work on lod
Diode should make me his apprentice /j
It‚Äôs not out for anyone
The only people who have it are testers
It will be done Before the end of February
But it might not release for a short bit after because lod
If lod is done as well tho
Release in 2 weeks
:clueless:
You have no idea how hard the grind is about to go this week
Yeah i don‚Äôt take a year to develop
I have off the whole week
I plan to finish the last content piece, liquid fueling
And then
Polish time
I should be able to grind through it all in a full week off
Fluids implemented and engine is piss easy to make
Why would it need complex maths
It‚Äôs a generator
You don‚Äôt need complex maths to make an rpm
It will have different quality fuels though
But so will everything liquid fueled so
Yeah and it launches you back
It‚Äôs not done yet tho
?
Well yeah it takes longer to get up to speed
But it will eventually reach the same rpm
Lol
Well actually propellors when overstressed will slow down but not immediately disassemble
They don‚Äôt work like normal create contraptions
Mostly because I coded an entire custom contraption type for them
:clueless:
They also produce an airstream capable of pulling or pushing mobs or players
Like a fan
But massive
It would be able to move ships but I‚Äôm lazy and haven‚Äôt implemented that
It‚Äôll come with polish
Along with disassembly, gravitron rework, infuser animation rework, visual fixes for all the blocks, etc
Polish is gonna be so much work üòÖ
But
Worth it
Fan propulsion is so pathetically easy that the only reason I haven‚Äôt implemented it is I‚Äôm busy with more important stuff
It‚Äôs a mixin and a 20 line controller class
üíÄ
I said I‚Äôd give you turbojets in 0.1.1 :3drevenge:
Afterblazers don‚Äôt output rotation so you can‚Äôt use them for it
The scalable jets wil
Yeah 0.1.1 gonna be essentially
Air update part 2
They probably won‚Äôt produce a shitload of rpm tho
Well we already have a jet engine
The afterblazer
Like afterburner but

I meant su
Shh
Rpm is a social construct in create obv
Like you can change the rpm of something in create too easily
Yeah
Lower speeds means less su cost
No
Jets work better above height limit actually
They have a higher top speed since you don‚Äôt need to wait for chunks to load up there
But they have their own height limit
???
Afterblazers have a height limit of around y 640
Double height limit
Also where rendering starts to get fucky
Y 640 is literally
Double height limit
No
It‚Äôs 320
Yeah
Propellors are worthless above height limit btw
Smh
Propellors fall off terrifyingly aggressively
To the point where sometimes a plane pointing straight up will just
Hang
Yeah, above 192 y they start falling off quickly in strength
They drop to 0.05% strength above y 320
Not really
You can comfortably cruise at y230 in a big plane
And occasionally rocket up in faster small planes
Plus propellors don‚Äôt require fuel beyond a lot of SU, they aren‚Äôt like afterblazers which require fuel injection
They‚Äôre also earlier than afterblazers in progression
Also, blimps
Propellors are so much better for blimps
Reason?
If you‚Äôre also spending it on fuel hungry jets
You‚Äôll cut your airtime in quarters
A simple blimp can run off a propellor, a combustion engine, and a burner on the cheapest fuel
They suck ass in combat though
Cause balloons
A lot of it
Cause when a balloon has no drag that‚Äôs what it does lol
So blimps by a result are
Kinda slow
In comparison to even a small aircraft
They are very much the tortoise to win the race
Describe it
Wdym
If it‚Äôs a contraption yeah
We haven‚Äôt implemented that but smacking a ship with a contraption at Mach 12 will launch it anyways
No actually
All you need is a Redstone signal and fuel input
The thing is you don‚Äôt expect a jet to fly for forever without refueling
So the need to refuel is like not bad
But for a blimp
Blimps just kinda exist
And considering you need nearly 3 minutes to lift off in a blimp sometimes
You dont wanna land and refuel constantly
Not an exaggeration btw big balloons can take a long fucking time to heat up
Especially since ballooners, the tiny burners, don‚Äôt currently support having more than one burner per bloon
Though that‚Äôs a bug not a feature
üíÄ
Would work
Im planning to make balloons kinda like contraptions
Storing every balloon as its own object
That way it doesn‚Äôt also just drop like a rock when the burner gets dropkicked
Yeah
Both work
But since no turboprops or turbojets yet
F35
Osprey will work better after 0.1.1
When I add turbojets that have a rotational output
There‚Äôs a whole war kinda going on rn over two updates
Essentially people are fighting over which update to be next
Terrain N‚Äô Tumble (Land)
Will be 0.2
There‚Äôs a bit of a duel
I plan to have a conclusion to said duel soon
The losing update will be 0.3
And the winning update will be 0.2
It‚Äôs not tiering and they aren‚Äôt worse in any capacity what
Ah yes my gigantic propellor which produces enough thrust to move a small country
Neither is better or worse
They have different use cases
Bro how high do you need to fly lol
That‚Äôs the entire point of the afterblazer
Also propellors work best when in tandem with jets anyways
Since afterblazers are weaker at lower speeds and lower altitudes and propellors are the opposite
You underestimate how strong propellors are
That falloff is aggressive because otherwise propellors would literally *ignore* it
Watch the dogfighting video and get back to me
Well that‚Äôs not something you do with a propellor
In mc
No need to
You seem to be applying real world distance logic to a world with a height of 320 meters
üíÄ
And that has an endless void underneath it
Also why in gods name would you want to fight at those distances
In mc
At least in an addon that is intending to maintain mc styled
You can have whatever you want when we get to mekapi
Good luck editing my falloff math
I don‚Äôt even know how it works myself
:clueless:
LMAO
Ruby got mad at me for that one
It‚Äôs a function so yes
airPressure(double height);
It returns a value between 0 and 1 as a multiplier
Entirely defeating their balance and purpose but go on
They can go really fast wash üíÄ
I mean
While it‚Äôs true they can‚Äôt exceed their exhaust velocity in the propulsion they provide
You can it‚Äôs called an afterblazer
??
You can go really fast above world height
Supersonic is irrelevant when there is no speed of sound in mc
Also if you went at actual supersonic speeds
Not even c2me would be able to save you
Ah yes faster than average walking pace
Riddle me this squidward
What happens when you are going at that speed
And you drop below y320
So you want to summon the kraken
Or tear a ship to pieces
Once collision damage
Or both really
Also slight hitch in your plans
Props also have a maximum exhaust velocity
Their top speed is dependent on their sail count
If you had a truly monumental propellor
No there is a top speed
That‚Äôs the problem
You can‚Äôt adjust it easily
If you adjust it too high then giant props will be enough to achieve 99%C
LMAO
Only balloons have drag and that‚Äôs because they physically need it to work
Fluid sim air drag is like
A bit out :Troll:
You need a fluid sim to properly calculate aerodynamic forces on a craft
You just put two words together
And said them
That doesn‚Äôt work though
You can‚Äôt just do that
Doing a raycast of a ship from the angle of its movement vector to get ‚Äúaerodynamics‚Äù is how you have someone make a glass cone at the front of a cube and call it a day
Nah it‚Äôs more that ships can‚Äôt possibly achieve that speed
Well that‚Äôs because you dared to use a bearing propellor
And paid the price
For your foolishness
Yeah I know lol
:Troll:
There are a number of reasons that this doesn‚Äôt work and I don‚Äôt understand all of them myself
But Ruby has said no
Also I dunno about you but running a raycast on an entire ship every single physics tick
Sounds absolutely horrible
? But it does
People have used spinners for props
@JayTheCoder @Wash there‚Äôs my answer for why the grid system doesn‚Äôt work, you can ask Ruby or triode for the physical reason why
Balloons produce drag
:clueless:
On land
Friction will be lod handled
In air
It‚Äôs different
Okay here‚Äôs my question
Try and slide that across the ground
Shitload of friction right
Now throw it through the air
Pretend it‚Äôs somehow a perfect cone with an infinitely sharp tip made of rubber and don‚Äôt ask how that‚Äôs possible
Yes it is
That‚Äôs the thing
Lod friction values will be no use in air
What if I yeet null‚Äôs cloud destroyer  at an angle at Mach 12
That thing is massive
I‚Äôd have to run a raycast to every single point
Wash the raycast would have to be from the direction you‚Äôre moving in and the orientation of your craft
What if you‚Äôre moving forward and your ship is sideways
Or at a weird fuckin angle
What if one of your sides is a solid wall and the other is a long cone??
Averaging doesn‚Äôt solve everything
I feel like I‚Äôm interpreting wash‚Äôs solution wrong
My head was thinking
No that‚Äôs what I thought wash was suggesting originally
üíÄ
Now I see why Ruby thinks washy drag won‚Äôt work
Baking drag for 6 directions and then averaging doesnt solve anything
You might as well *=.99
Ksp aerodynamics are actually real aerodynamic calculations nowadays
They used to not be
Blimp
It‚Äôs definitely not
You can move and break ksp ship parts
Drag very important for blimp
Blimp needed drag to function at all actually
Without air resistance balloons bob up and down infinitely Ewou
Ewou
That‚Äôs how a balloon works
üíÄ
Blimp applies a resistance force equal to -0.05* to its momentum (velocity * inertia matrix)
Want to see a video of the balloon before I added drag
Lemme grab it
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1038344793979371530/1074443213429022810/2023-02-12_16-32-02.mp4
Without air resistance balloons will shoot up, run out of air pressure to speak of, fall back down, be unable to slow down, catch themselves, rise back up
Repeat
They can only equalize themselves with drag
No
It literally isn‚Äôt
We tried changing the graph, it does not fix it
You need drag for a balloon to stabilize itself
Otherwise the only force acting on it is gravity
Also balloons produce a shitload of drag irl so I‚Äôm really not sure what your point is @ewoudjeüöÄ
One thing I will say
Even though washy drag seems very sus
I‚Äôd rather have it than 0.05
So
For balloons anyways
1. Yes it is
Because it means the balloon has a way to slow down other than just applying less force
Gravity doesn‚Äôt help it slow down when it‚Äôs going downwards
Which it should
Since it‚Äôs made of cloth
And should be very drag heavy
Not enough
Because again air resistance is important
For balloons
Eureka balloons don‚Äôt apply a force
maybe the fact that eureka ships auto slowdown or something
Ya know
Cause that‚Äôs their entire point
When you let go of a key in eureka
You just stop moving
Riddle me this
Is stabilization not the same concept
As 0.99
It doesn‚Äôt turn off angularly ever :clueless:
Eureka balloons also don‚Äôt have a height cap
I‚Äôve shown what happens when they do
Takeoff balloons
Guess what takeoff balloons do
Bob uncontrollably
Of no drag
SO THEY DO HAVE THE SOLUTION
bruh
Applying drag is a less rigid way of doing that
LMAO
So I am right trol
let‚Äôs go
anyways my point is Moot anyways
Washy drag will do
But what about angular momentum
That is horrific
I see why it was changed
Tried, it‚Äôs not ever going to completely stop bobbing without some force of resistance
Like drag
Maybe for angular drag we
Though that seems scuffed
Or just add drag üíÄ
I feel like I‚Äôm dying
There is none since it‚Äôs not real drag
It‚Äôs just washy drag smh
Call it wash resistance
I was playing dodgeball in pe
I was running for an hour and couldn‚Äôt feel my lungs
I am in pain
Wait a second
I have realized an issue with the prebaked drag
@Wash
Specifically in the case of clockwork
@ewoudjeüöÄ pinging you too
Compound collision shapes
They will
Triode is finishing that up actually
He finished the api side just doing the krunch side
They don‚Äôt apply to the block grid and they‚Äôre constantly moving but they‚Äôre still part of the ship‚Äôs compound collision shape and have mass
And conservation of momentum
And other things
If you ignore contraptions entirely in drag that would be sus
Meaning you‚Äôd have to refresh drag once every gametick
Which is vine thud eyebrow raise
If you don‚Äôt account for them
You could make a perfectly balanced rectangle
üíÄ
Do you see the issue there
No
Prebaking doesn‚Äôt work when you have parts that are always spinning
Well think about this
From clockwork the issues are Flap bearings, propellors
Definitely not create‚Äôs fault
This is just why prebaking aerodynamics doesn‚Äôt work for things that move
Or change
Like a plane model you can prebake
But
A ship made of blocks
Is too sussy
Vs1 should never be used as reference
It had rudders
Wings better :Troll:
And flaps
Honestly cambered wings are bleh
The constant pull up pensive
Not all wings
Jet wings don‚Äôt
:clueless:
Angle of attack
Basically the wing will always be at an angle
So it‚Äôll always produce lift
A symmetrical wing does not produce lift if moving perfectly parallel
A cambered wing does
However symmetrical wings have an advantage
:3drevenge:
Can‚Äôt be cheated around that easily
Speed can change
After all
Bro I swear this server only knows how to ask the same question
Yes eventually
No we aren‚Äôt using a shitty sealed room algorithm
Aero uses sealed rooms for ‚Äú‚Äùoccluding‚Äù‚Äù water
1. They just disable rendering, not even particles
And they‚Äôve said themselves they don‚Äôt use an efficient sealed room algorithm
Indirectly by saying ‚Äúsealed room calculations are expensive‚Äù
Nah bro mc‚Äôs inability to utilize gpu or multiple threads will cuck you anyways
Floodfill sucks
Hence why we don‚Äôt have ship splitting yet because using floodfill to split ships is
Disgusting
But dynamic connectivity is another thing on the conveyor belt of things to solve
It‚Äôs also one I can‚Äôt help with since all of that stuff is on Ruby and triode to do
Also
A quick explanation
Dynamic connectivity is essentially finding a path between two points
If there‚Äôs no path between the points it‚Äôs considered not connected
Hence you can do things like leaking balloons or split ships
Problem
It‚Äôs not an easy problem to solve
It‚Äôs even harder to solve in a 3D space
??
Bruh
Vs uses the ram allocated to mc
Yeah
Correct
That‚Äôs not vs2 doing that
I intend to try and look into helping with it possibly once clockwork is ready
Probably
No
Essentially
Imagine a 3x3x12 box of blocks
Say I cut out one block from the center
Check the tree
Yes they are, through a path around that block
Now in another scenario
No
There is no longer a path
Aero devs deleted my post of the flight of the idiot ages ago
:(
I just wanna go home and work on clockwork rn but of course the day I have motivation and the first day of my break i have work until 8pm
:tiredofyourshit:
I have
Me and Ryan are like supercooled magnets we repel eachother violently
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre worse than me
I do kinda make clockwork
They‚Äôre losing their minds
Reaper was vibing in vs2 vc during the shalz funny moment stream
This sure is interesting

Posted 1 day ago, current post
Bro I have a job
üíÄ
Wagie moment
At work rn
Smh
SHIFT up
I am
Off my shift
Bro why does your scratch look like
Scifi
I‚Äôm right here
The fact that it‚Äôs made in scratch
And also is 2d
And your 53 check one
Would be
and anything more complex than a dart would be
500k+
So no
You have to remember that this calculation will run on any and every airship
Regardless of size or shape
So if someone makes a shit brick but a detailed shitbrick
This has to check every single bit
It‚Äôs not going to work lol
SMH my head
But yeah no this is just stupid
This is like floodfill vs dynamic connectivity
not to diss your effort cause the fact you made it in scratch is
Bruh
But
It‚Äôs not gonna work in 3d with massive crafts
yes
Very much so
I feel like the raycasts are gonna end up being less performant than a hyper low res fluid sim
üíÄ
Well it‚Äôs a fluid sim
That‚Äôs not how that
Works
It‚Äôs a simulation
February 28th
:Troll:
but
That‚Äôs when it‚Äôll be done
I can‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôll release
Since lod

MekAPI plans to have vr support
For controlling its vehicles with vr controls
That‚Äôs a mock-up animation
*insert stock music*
Essentially
Modeled vehicles with physics

Models as in

You do realize that
Everything in mc is a model right
Like
‚Ä¶tech would know that null

Hinges are in vs2
NINETEEN DOLLAR FORTNITE CARD
no
its not tournament
that was before tournament existed
thats using takeoff and eureka
tournament doesnt have a bearing
No we aren‚Äôt
We‚Äôre working on polish and other things that aren‚Äôt as easily sharable :E_sleepdeprived:
That too
No lol
But compound shapes will be

Combustion engine gaming
I‚Äôm at work
Dust is working on the initial implementation
I‚Äôll clean it up and then pass it to you testers
I get off at 8est
It‚Äôs 5:52
Combustion engine‚Äôs patch will also be joined by all of the blocks that are supposed to use liquid fuels
Using liquid fuels
So prepare yourselves :Troll:
For every existing creation to break
Well rn any afterblazer setup or ballooner setup
Uses stratodonuts
Those will no longer provide fuel :Troll:
Just a boost
No
They also use liquid fuel themselves
Also this means
That‚Äôs just the creative motor
üíÄ
The ballooner uses rpm for throttle
??
The creative motor is
Still a thing
What
We have our own types of liquid fuel
And ie petrol is easy to add
Thatd probably be a mid tier fuel
There‚Äôs low mid and high
And then stratofrosting which is :armold_schwarzenegger:
:stratodonut:
I‚Äôll be back
Work time
Still at work
Don‚Äôt ping me
Please
I LIVE
MY SHIFT IS OVER
finally
a day im not working
for
9 hours
jk i dont work 9 hours but shh
ive got a few planned
cranking out combustion engines rn
good morning project to wake me tf up
they do
latest cbc broke compat
use uhhh
hold on i have the beta somewhere that does work

it aims to be done before end of feb
the thing that broke compat was an ""optimization"" for how it detected block impacts
thats about it
so no
this build has autocannons for example
and the carriage
idk i dont use cbc much i dont remember everything lol
uhhh
the fuck is goin on with your game
thats weird
ive never seen that shit
??
what?
since when
are you sure about that
ü§®
if it can run on an iphone with like 4 gigs of ram total i sincerely doubt krunch disobeys ram limits to that degree
:E_sleepdeprived:
do you have fabric vs2
Clearly, you all don‚Äôt own an air frier.

How did we get
To cockwork is a blender render
Achievement Unlocked: [How Did We Get Here?]
speaking of models
im so bored rn
and i have no energy to do anything but model
ive been slamming my head against intellij all day
i have no coding brain
but i have no models left to make for clockwork
so im just kinda
sitting here
:Thonk:
dont you mean a spudling gun
:thonkhard:
i mean
the afterblazer
is a liquid fueled jet engine
and for minecraft's purposes that might as well be a rocket
no
the stratodonut doesnt fuel things
it wont in the final mod
its just like that for testing
the donut and other "frosted" pastries will be used to boost them
no
the creative item is still the creative blaze cake
you can use the creative blaze cake on uit
well kinda sorta
some will make you drain fuel slower
others will increase power and fuel consumption
atc
the afterblazer's flame model kinda sucks
üíÄ
you know what would fix that
not having your server get hijacked
:clueless:
maybe i will make a spudling gun
it could be funny
but what materials to make it out of
:Thonk:
well no shit
but not just copper
its gotta be an upgrade
to the cannon
also let me be clear
this spudling gun
would be absolutely massive
assuming it has
4 barrels
the size of
the potato cannon's barrels
rotating
LMFAO
THAT ONE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
okay a rotary potato cannon is not gonna work sorry gamers
im gonna have to find some other design
because
i cant make that shit look good compressed down
fuck it
rollin into battle with the

????
potato cannon is a
create feature
???
uhhh
its alright
a tad round tho
:Troll:
with great vehicular manslaughter
comes a great need for firepower
theres no reason to make a sniper or shotgun potato cannon variant
you can already get that with ammo types
the only thing youd want an upgraded potato cannon to have is
sheer fire rate
there is actually going to be a mounted potato autocannon but not in the way you think
its waiting on vs bodies :clueless:
ive mentioned it before
someone grab the explanation
aeugh nvm im too lazy ill type it out again
VSBodies = generic, non block physics objects
aka rigid/softbodies
aw hell naw this look goofy ah hell without textures
insert shitty cartoon sound effects
bro the actual potato cannon aint much better without textures
check this shit out\
*vine thud*
handle is only 1 thick
cause otherwise it was goofy ahh
blockbench shitting the bed is what it is

so true
bulked it up a little

thats a skill issue of
block/item models
lol
rotation limit of 22.5 degree increments üíÄ

just a little
wait
NO
WHAT HAVE I DONE
NO
WAIT
NONONONONO

aeugh
it turns it into a farter
:clueless:
thats why it looks like a toilet seat
its starting to come together
actually
i wont spoil it yet
why not
i might as well give some misc fun features
i already am planning on an overly complicated for-fun feature for the next release
the funny is complete
i can rest now
because
BEHOLD IT

they told me to make a potato machine gun
and i delivered
thwoopthwoopthwoopthwoopthwoop
dont ask why i tryharded the texture
i dont know
:clueless:


sup nerds
nah bro
we halo styling this shit
nah i de-mogused it
the cockworker
OH NO
oh wait
i thought you found a mogus
no
thats just blockbench lol
??
cant you just
vertex snap
it doesnt show up in game
just in blockbench
you can use the vertex snap tool
to automatically
align two pieces
by their vertexes
press x
while in blockbench edit mode
:clueless:
no thats literally what it is
the hotkey is x

Hopefully
I‚Äôm gonna begin the polish grindset once combustion engine is done
As that‚Äôs the last vital feature
And then if I have time I‚Äôll cram in the potatling gun
Even though it‚Äôs really not a Gatling gun anymore
:3drevenge:
I won‚Äôt post the autotato (still needs a name) in the clockwork channel yet
Since I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll be able to include it in 0.1
Rethinking voxels sucks with vs2
The shadows get mega fucked
By ships
I awaken today with regained purpose
I must finish what I started

pew pew
I‚Äôll call it the ‚ÄúPastrymaker‚Äù
Like peacemaker
Lmfao
well this is an upgraded potato cannon @instasnipe
It‚Äôs already the upgraded version
@YAROBONZ imagine the melon warfare you could commit with this thing
Ships don‚Äôt stand a chance
It will fire the same way but with a stupid fire rate and a doubly stupid firing velocity
if you can‚Äôt be precise against fast vessels
That‚Äôs cause you‚Äôre lame :clueless: /j
Who wouldn‚Äôt want to weigh someone‚Äôs ship out of the sky by shooting melons at them
also I‚Äôm adding small explosive ammunition
Either
I‚Äôll help in a minute
I could always make the jack-o-boom the strong explosive
Just tiny explosions
You can already start fires with blaze cakes
why is it so accurate for the wojak
was it fed the appearance of a redditor
hmm
someone give me a good THWOOMP

3. never auto disassemble
ayy game launched
time to test the combustion engine
that texture is
hideous
im not gonna lie to you
maybe i will
:clueless:
tbh
i might acvtually retexture it
and send it to them
that left texture is just
well
its detailed
but it just looks like üò¨
guh
i mean im glad dynamics is updated
but
no item ducts ü§®
and
fugly textures
so idk how to feel
EWWW
IM SORRY
BUT LIKE
:guh:
WHAT IS THAT
but thermal :(
look at how they massacred my boy

Y‚Äôall can flounder in hell for all i care
Flounder implying you‚Äôre a fish on land
Fully implemented
it took like 2 hours lol
that was back before i planned for the version numbers
or when the team battle started
check the date lol
bluperglue isnt that laggy
its less bad than vanilla create glue
:clueless:
thats not an airship thats a tube
Small warning
I still don‚Äôt have a single clue why
also it‚Äôs su output is ludicrous on fabric (haven‚Äôt tested if that issue is there on forge)
(It doesn‚Äôt just keep speeding up)
Propellors don‚Äôt provide force anymore after a certain speed is reached
It‚Äôs physically impossible
for you to get infinite speed out of them
That‚Äôs the rim of the block
You can connect a pipe to that end and it‚Äôll line up correctly, so it‚Äôs intended
That‚Äôs not even a takeoff block you‚Äôre using
This is from tournament
That thruster
or just use cockwork
:clueless:
i mean clockwork
You ever have like a list of priorities
Snap open a slim jim
slim jim no good
perhaps
the main issue with interfaces is that
they dont actually work world-to-world right now even
so we'd have to write an entire new behavior for them
or just make our own version
im gonna die of death :diesofdeath:
:3drevenge:
the angular speed of every sail block is
so yes
they dont even have sounds yet
:clueless:
you see id do that but i genuinely have no idea how
wero you did make a datapack
the data folder in the mod resources is a datapack
therefore
you made a datapack
do i smell copium
in this chat
i cant help you sorry gamer
and its
completely different üíÄ
what to do rn :Thonk:
with clockwork's content all implemented in some form the only thing left to do is polish and model
but i dont want to
texture
rn
at least not fluids cause i hate animated textures in mc
:3drevenge:
i had a sudden modelling spark and so
not for cockwork tho

ivy got an upgrade

smh
ü§®
ü§®
that's because
she isnt a gardener anymore
she's gone from secondary mascot of create R&D to primary mascot of something else i've got in the works
because i always have things in the works
:clueless:
well technically she's still part of R&D
R&D is really the banner all of my create addons fall under
nope, mekapi doesnt have a mascot
unless you count the meka
by the way that ""secret"" project of mine that she's the mascot of now is pretty easy to discern if you know whats been going down in the create addon sphere recently and if you know what aesthetic ivy's redesign is
smh
discord people coping
anything new

death inbound
so true
it is
Ivy's gone atomic
i mean she was a gardener so clean energy is her deal
yes
i got pinged
thats why
:clueless:
i completely remade ivy from scratch using klarkson mark 2 as a base because her old model was not salvagable
clockwork will be *done* by end of feb
the possibility of it releasing at the end of feb
is there
but its unlikely
considering lod
is not done
wait damn
we havent moved the clock in ages
i may or may not have forgotten about it
üíÄ
well since all major content is implemented in some way
i can move it a few spaces
wait wtf its still at *9*?
we're at like
11 at least now
ü§®

fatal mistake
NO NO NO NO NO
üíÄ
bro its a robot
üíÄ
how did this turn from me posting about funny robot model
to
minecraft sex
i mean honestly yall arent original
R&D's wanted to get at Ivy for months
üíÄ
LMAO
ü§®
bro what the fuck
ü§®
klarkson and ivy are roughly the same size, with ivy being a little shorter
he got wider and shorter
because he looked like a twig
ivy still looks like a twig

size comparison
for people who think ivy's like 9 feet tall
@Zakimon502
the mech is 7.35 blocks tall
üíÄ
klark is shorter
or
ivy is shorter
i cant math
or type
@Belmont bootie clappa
nono
its the bow
she's like 4 pixels shorter

ü§®
klarkson's arms are literally as thick as her torso wdym
he could throw her
heels?
with what feet
she has stilt legs

she's literally got
a peg leg
og ivy was too short
she was like
0.75 size
and her pixels were the wrong size too because she was literally rescaled
üíÄ
üíÄ
mf klarkson is built like a rectangle

old ivy was aggressively short
üíÄ

with the headwrap its hard to tell

she's like 50% psychotic 50% atomic family stereotype
so
i mean

old
vs

cat

yes
That is how you pronounce caesar

Middle one
they never decided to
retroactively move their old stuff
to the new system
:clueless:
yeah
blockpatterns support arbitary sizes
lod is level of detail
friction
shit like that
no
:clueless:
i prefer february 30th
its pretty important
otherwise you can
like
make a lightspeed car
since theres no friction
no the plan was to wait for lod
otherwise no belt treads
i thought lod would be done a lot earlier which is why
????
that has nothing to do with bugs
well the lod update also has
multithreaded krunch
yeah but not krunch
the engine still only uses uno
it must use as many as humanly possible
thats not even a ship
thats a kidney bean

god has no domain over minecraft
if you couldnt tell by the people wanting to fuck the robot

it doesnt work anymore

slow ass cbc cannon round
not going to work
youd have to lead your shots until next sunday
axolotl
planes in clockwork can travel at stupid speeds

they can do something called
maneuver

no you cant
cbc cannons are slow as hell

256 rpm aint gonna save you
you gotta love the sheer copium

yaro has achieved lightspeed
again
if my plane
rams into the ass of your ship at mach 12
and then explodes
i think i know why it doesnt
:Thonk:
here's the issue
how are you detecting the plane to begin with
unless it has a computer onboard
i guess you could use valkyrien computers' radar
but
its not going to be very accurate
and i dont think the radar returns the vessel's speed
you could do even more math to calculate the speed
but then you're wasting precious time
you could be using to aim
or you know
shoot at it yourself
and still probably miss
yep
computers only run at
20tps
and ships move at 60tps
üíÄ
it literally would be 3 ticks behind
at the BEST of times
thats assuming the math doesnt lag
yeah
they move on the physics tick
which is 60tps
instead of 20tps
im going to overthrow it
:clueless:
ü§®
sus
yall can throw sus comments at ivy but dont throw shit at me i aint interested
ive given up trying to stop people
valkyrien computers radar could
theoretically
be useful

no he doesnt deserve that level of attention
the clown suit on login with clockwork is a privilege
reserved for only true :E_clown:s
like ryanhcode
üíÄ
nah that would mean they have their uuid immortalized in the code somewhere
as i said
too much attention
You do not understand the way thst can be perceived
No
It works with normal vs2
Lol
So by extension it works with clockwork
First thing clockwork had was trains on ships
Like back on January 7th
So is clockwork itself
:clueless:
It‚Äôs only been 2 months in dev
Speed is key
That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôve got

Reminder that the first thing I spent forever on in clockwork dev was 100% style
Yes
It‚Äôs chiptune waves
Most of them are noise crashes
The last one is a sine with a very low pass

The infuser anim is being reworked
Nah

Obama grilled cheese sandwich
I haven‚Äôt textured the fluids

Animated textures are not going to be fun
Especially for

3 low tiers 4 mid tiers 3 high tiers and then strato
Lame
I‚Äôm gonna do it like create chocolate style
Frostings ‚ú®
Nah chocolate frosting is low tier
Same with vanilla and berry
Mid tiers are the weird frostings made of definitively not food
High tiers are mid tiers mixed with low tiers
And strato is every single other frosting mixed
If you couldn‚Äôt tell
Getting your hand on stratofrosting or :stratodonut:
Is gonna be a bitch
We‚Äôll just assume Minecraft‚Äôs atmosphere is hyper oxygen rich
Since it has bugs the size of a meter cubed
Which makes glucose fuel viable
I mean considering everything in vs2 operates on absurd weight scales (because a single block is a full meter cubed-)
Wouldn‚Äôt be far fetched üíÄ
It could be done but I‚Äôm going to put ways to deter such a thing in the mid
I won‚Äôt outright disable them like aero
Because I‚Äôm not cringe
I‚Äôll just make them less effective or something to balance out how busted windmills are
No, waterwheels are piss weak and water itself is very heavy
Windmills can solo power shit rn

Vs2 1.19 port is ‚Äúdone‚Äù and waiting to merge upstream so it‚Äôs possible clockwork could follow
But it‚Äôd be delaying release to have to port it
And maintain two versions at once
No I mean
It actually is

It‚Äôs waiting for merge

But that‚Äôs the sea update for clockwork
It‚Äôs gonna add winds and cross winds
Admittedly it‚Äôs a bit hard to know exactly what to contribute
Uhhhh
I started working a bit on dynamic connectivity stuff but triode wants that in a seperate c++ project üíÄ
So I‚Äôm not contributing to vs core for it
I‚Äôm just writing my own bullshit in the corner
And clockwork has priority over it
I have a test library in Java actually already
It is not good
Lol
And I know c++
No
I was messing with the Java one I found to get it to work in 3d
And uh
Me and dust got somewhere kinda
Well it‚Äôs two vertexes
Wait no that‚Äôs the wrong way to explain it
Vertex‚Äôs are
Two numbers
Not two vertexes
Ignore my brain fart
It‚Äôs not a 3d coordinate it‚Äôs a 2d coordinate
Nevermind i was thinking about the wrong thing
Sorry I‚Äôm tired
Ignore me
We did make some progress with the library though
üëç
I gotta go look at it to remember what we actually accomplished
If it happens again, this time it won‚Äôt be an uneven battle
I meant that metaphorically
They won‚Äôt have the so to speak high ground

Windows can run shit from like 1992 with some file properties
I don‚Äôt know what that is

i would not wish that fate upon anyone
stay strong brother üòî
@Wash
im speedrunning adding forces to fans
quick
whats a fair pitch for each prop
doing the math rn
the pitch is in inches for some reason
i dont know propellors goodly
smh
i dont care
accurate encased fan math funnier
so 20 inch pitch?
thats what i googled
i have no idea if that translates
:clueless:
ALSO OH NO
MY PRODUCTIVITY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STTTp9nDFOE
:fear:
ITS OUT
I NEED
FINISH FANS
SO I CAN PLAY
PLEASE WASH
IN INCHES
:diesofdeath:
maybe idk
but
inches
give
like
uh
i cant read that bro just hand number
not that deep
does that say 38
in the middle
prop diameter is 1 meter
so
39 inch prop
0.018346457
that doesnt seem right
there are props that are 5 inch blades
with like
a pitch of 4 inches
oh wait
nvm
i had millimeters up
18.34 inches
there we go
üò∞ @Wash
okay maybe
accurate math not fair
LOL
>0.008 hp
i could treat 256:1
so
this is at 1rpm
256 * 256
is what
okay so if i treat 256rpm as 1 rpm
then when the fan is actually spinning at
256
65536rpm
LMFAO
IT DIDNT LIKE THAT
fair
LMFAO
this is with the stupid number
uhh
2560 is still rather low

actually
wait
...
i dont think they can
that might be a bit too low...
encased fans weigh
`Encased Fan - 235kg`
it cannot lift
its own weight
it can move 32 kg and it weighs 235
yeah
i mean
this isnt accounting for prop weight even
you should be able to make a prop spin
and fly itself
if you had voodoo magic to do so
but with this
you physically cant
it just wont
even if it is self powered somehow
yeah
it is one of the lightest blocks in the mod
the waterwheel right above it comes in at a staggering

4375 kilos
you do not want to see the reaction wheel's weight
:MENACING:

its two 9000kg wheels
https://spencergoesflying.net/hosted/static_thrust/
there is no real world reference
nobody makes a fan out of andesite and spruce wood
reaction wheels will make plane flight uh
strange
theyre not meant for planes
theyre meant for like
drones
big ships
stuff that cant turn easily
im not gonna .lie wash
i dont know
lol
increasing the CF to 2
made the thrust double
still cant lift its own weight
at max rpm
i feel like
we should base this off game logic
so
at 16 rpm should the fan be able to move its own weight
so we need to produce exactly 235 kilogram-force
at 16 rpm
its a block my guy
is pitch like way too large then
did you goofy the math
uhhhh
i have a 1m^3 reference of andesite
Andesite Block - 2770 kg
a 1m^3 hunk of andesite is
2770 kilos
it changes the speed
but not the force
weirdchamp
a lot
oh by the way
reaction wheel weight is generous
it should actually be more
a copper block almost weighs 9000kg
its like 8700 ish
so
one wheel is only slightly more than a copper block
despite them being much larger in diameter

this one says it produces even less
@Wash
15.7 kg force
üíÄ
nono
melon warfare
you see
it can move 38kg now
üíÄ
even with 25
okay real world math isnt gonna cut this then
we'll have to bend the numbers
just a little
okay so instead of rw math
i want it to provide exactly its weight's worth of force at 16rpm and provide diminishing returns
so uh
anyone good at slapping together graphs
well
i mean
otherwise what is the point
if it cant move its own weight
and its one of the lightest blocks
itll be entirely useless
yeah but uh
just make the graph not scale very goodly
not linear
axo if you ping me mid convo again i will send your ass back to the 3000 dollar server room
yes but gameplay > realism for this specific piece
you already have accurate giant props
you dont need accurate little shit fans
true
do 64 then
either way i need a funny graph
with 64 rpm : 235 kg force
all i need is an exponential with a point that matches exactly that
idc
about the rest
lol
yeah
you know that vs2 already has that
for like
vanilla blocks right
üíÄ
true
theyre cowards
tournament
takeoff
happy hour
anyways anyone good at making exponentials pls
aegh
gotta do math
pensive
well a fan physically wouldnt be able to move anything
rn
oh wait im silly
its just
y1 = ab^x1
so
64 = ab^235
should be right
or wait
is that backwards
its 235 = ab^64
im dumb
i really cant math
i actually have a kofi
for commissions
:clueless:
anyways thats no rampant fern ai, fern ai is suicidal
remember
smh
i cant math
all of it
anyways im stuck on max speed stuff
idk what the max speed of the encased fan should be
existing exhaust velocity calc n owork
cause
designed for propellor contraption
nah
upped to 64
but regardless
if no max speed
will perpetually get faster and faster
and nnever slow down
since no drag
which is cringe and unbased
yeah it seems more like a control thrustere
hmmm
alright
fans done
testing time
i will
and then
im buying ksp2
and streaming it until i go to work
:clueless:
dont care
ratio
ksp2
i think the bad reviews are just because
its in a very basic state rn
and private divison forced them to publish it
before it was ready
but hey
i kinda want to  see it day 1 tho
for comparisons later
im sure it will vastly improve
no it wont
oh whoopsie i goofied a little
was wondering why fan wasnt moving anything
i definitely didnt forget to add the mixin to the list
smh
HOLY SHIT WHOOPSIE
I MIGHTVE MADE THE FAN A BIT TOO STRONG

nah im just messin
as you could see with the sandstone block
it is so piss weak it can only move fast if it is entirely on its own
and thats because its weight isnt configured yet
:clueless:

ill do you one better
posting the build to testers once ci finishes it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93PpmEeOEKs
it has happened
danny2462 has not only made a triumphant return
but has recreated
his first video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCRu1tdPkJ4&t=0s
ci is building
i gotta wait for it
:clueless:

damn
nah jk it just failed to publish to maven
:clueless:
gamers
i have acquired
ksp 2
:diesofdeath:
im gonna stream it so cope
:clueless:
i have wagie job in 3 hours

first cocket
I HAVE ACHIEVED MY FIRST ORBIT
IN KSP2

ONLY TOOK 2 TRIES BECAUSE TIMEWARP TO POINT IS BROKEN
AND I WARPED PAST APOAPSIS
LOL
time to send jeb back home
time to return

oh its fun but like
performance is inexcusable
its using 90% of my gpu
on low settings
i have a 3080
my parachute is tweakin
also
no re entry effects
ü§®
nah bro its very barebones
its like
beta ksp
its definitely cool
well its early access
yes
you should
100% wait
its not worth it rn
anyways the gameplay isnt really the problem
the problem is the performance
again even if i had good perf
nono
i knew it wasnt
i was well aware
i bought it anyways
cope
consistent
but probably wouldnt be for someone without a beefy pc
and i again had low settings on
with high settings i was using 85% of my gpu
...
:clueless:
uhhhhhhhh
sound good
but
not optimized at all
2070 will run
but defo low settings
oh also
reaction wheels suck ass now
they are waaaaay weaker
like
its not even comparable
they got nerfed
hard
you need to actively control a ship now which is kinda fair but
very annoying for ascent
?
im not talking about clockwork reaction wheels
im talking about ksp 2
reaction wheels
üíÄ
it uses gpu a lot better than ksp1 did
cpu usage was like
average for me
i9 10850k
:clueless:
but actually
discord was fighting ksp2 for cpu usage üíÄ
It‚Äôs better for what I do
:clueless:
It‚Äôs better for what I do because it costs like 200$ instead of 560$?
And I don‚Äôt make a ton of money?
Plus it‚Äôs way behind generationally so comparing them isn‚Äôt really fair, especially considering the price gap
Correct
I work at shoprite
strong words from the 13 year old
Sorry I put a 1
I meant 3
That would be depressing
Water cooling
ü§®
Bruh man must do commissions for furries on twitter or something
to have that money
Clearly you don‚Äôt know the method
Get rich quick easy:
Step 1
Open commissions
Step 2
Slide ‚Äúfurries allowed‚Äù in front of commissions
Step 3
Wait for dms
Nah nah nah
Doing it yourself is better
If you use ai art you likely have to pay for a subscription for those stable diffusion generators
No good
Catch 22
No money for good enough pc to gen
But can‚Äôt make money without gen
the rich get richer
anyways ive been saving for a while
i do actually have money saved up
hence why i was able to get ksp 2 without too much remorse
but uh
i dont wanna use it on pc parts
Fun fact
That mod stole clockwork‚Äôs tag
We almost had clockwork on curseforge
They beat us to it by like a week
where
I AM MAKING
PANCAKES
but not just any pancake, no
condensed milk pancakes
reaction wheels are for people who want to live life on easy mode when making helis
But
Not really
Well we have blimps so that counts as an airship
How light do you think a heli is
No
That is why you have chad combustion engine
Ornithopter isn‚Äôt possible rn since I don‚Äôt think pushing wings down produces lift
No proper drag
:(
No
Because a stirling engine is a flywheel driven liquid fuel injected engine
That is intentionally exposed to air
And a combustion engine is an enclosed liquid fuel injected engine
That does not get exposed
:clueless:
If you meant aero‚Äôs stirling engine, they don‚Äôt have an actual sterling engine
They have a coal engine they renamed sterling
Stirling sterling idk
One of the two lol
If you stick something and then you assemble the train yes
unlikely now since lod
But it will be close
Clockwork will be ready and waiting to release by the end of feb hopefully
It‚Äôs close ish
I got more polish to do
They don‚Äôt in normal create
So
?
The alternator and electric motor in cc&a are just a fancy renamed energy conversion tool
you can do that if you stick it before the train is assembled as I said
Sideways is too situational but
Crushing force
Hmm
Well actually
Maybe it should just be hitting at a velocity regardless of direction
Liftoff or takeoff
Yeah it will
All vs addons work together
Mostly
Eureka doesn‚Äôt always play nice
its ported actually
waiting for merge i think
alpha finished it not too long ago
probably not immediately
unless yall want a delay
:Troll:
We‚Äôre all just gonna say ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù :Troll:

Giga clown moment
Sent it trol
It was literally on the blimp video

No, you cannot be a clockwork tester
To wheatdos
Did they beat you
Good point
He‚Äôs going on the list
The clown uuid list
Depends
not gonna lie gamers
but
on the other hand

ho-ly shit
(not my screenshot i aint gotten my ass to jool yet)
and yes
though no engines will start down there due to pressure
so you will die


yeah the performance and shit day one is just
horrific
but
its really fuckin cool once you get past that
its very clearly an early early alpha state
and to be fair you really dont want to optimize things before you finish core systems
because optimizations can break existing shit or in development features
is it worth 50 dollars?
when its done
and when the roadmap is finished
absolutely
cause right now
you can kinda
take the ksc to space
and thats not right

cope, its unplayable for everyone
it lags for me and i have a 3080
the great equalizer
and yet it still runs better than ksp1 at times üíÄ
and it doesnt have ksp 1's abysmal load times
ksp2 loading is like
5 seconds
ksp 1 loading is like
12 years
mans runnin on a floppy disk
gonk
im just gonna not answer that as youve had that same question answered
minimum of 232 times
Insanity
:speen:
too much rn
lol
i cant change it though because create's stress system hates me or something
props cost 0 su right now :Troll:
because even though they say they have a stress impact
it isnt being applied at all
and i am clueless as to why
because it worked before
because of a bug yes
the what now engine
do they have batching on
if not then its probably a compat issue
again

A labyrinth with no exit
A maze with no prize
You don‚Äôt even realize that you are trapped, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber
Always seeming so near
Yet somehow out of reach
But you will never find them. None of you will.
This is where your story ends
And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this aisle- not intended for you
Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that‚Äôs not what you want
I have a feeling you‚Äôre right where you want to be
I am remaining as well. This place will not be remembered- and the memory of everything that started this can finally start to fade away- as the agony of every crappy piece of furniture should
And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still- and give up your meatballs
They don‚Äôt belong to you
For some of you, I believe there is peace, after the smoke clears
But for one of you- the jaws of Blahaj have opened to swallow you whole- so don‚Äôt keep the plushie aisle waiting, old friend.
My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you wouldn‚Äôt be content to disappear. Not my daughter. I‚Äôm sorry that on that day- the day you got lost, and left to die- no one was there to lead you to the front end, like you led others yourself
I couldn‚Äôt save you then. So let me save you now.

bro he's 5'6
and he weighs 97 lbs
thats not super underweight thats about
like
10 lbs
ive seen people who are 17 lbs underweight
thats very fuckin untrue
like
incredibly wrong
no that is straight up wrong
someone who isnt dead?
.
his bmi is like 14.7
both are under 18.5
my doctor says im healthy and within the healthy range of being underweight
BMI is not an accurate reference
.
body mass index
no
its useful as a guide
but it isnt the flat answer
it depends on the person
all of my weight is skin bones and muscle troll
anyways
at least im not gonna die like 90% of americans by the age of 47 due to complications from obesity
:clueless:
depends on where you live
the stereotype that americans are all fat is false yes
but like
if you live in some states
no
theres a reason that rep exists after all lol
but then no cockwork

i work for the gamers
not for myself
smhj
i balance a wagie job and cockwork and yet ive made more content in 2 months than they have in 2 updates
:clueless:
nah i suck at worldgen
dont blame microsoft for mojang's own problems
mojang doesnt function as a team unit
microsoft being there is icing on the cake
yes
there is
you cannot blame le funny megacorp for all the problems of mc
didnt they hire the creator of thermal series or smthn
and the creator of the aether
only to have them
literally just exist
and not use any of their talents
maybe thats why modern thermal series sucks so much
üíÄ
too busy changing lang files
a 2.0 update implies too much new stuff
it will never happen
mojang no have work effort
they have infinite money printer
its like oreo making nonsensical new flavors just for the hell of it
they already won the game
theyre just on a victory lap

so bedrock?
i mean
and the horrific marketplace
bedrock is fundamentally better than java
from a performance stnadpoint
its 100% less spaghetti code
if bedrock
was moddable like mc java
it would be
perfect
like there would be no reason to really use java at that point
bedrock has underwater redstone
:clueless:
yes it does
i just explained
i was saying
if it had
mods
it would be better
flat out
because mods could fix any innacuracies or missing features
mc
but with a far better base
less jank
if mods all problems of that fixed
its the spaghetti code thats a problem in java mc
bedrockification
i mean
yes
id rather a split that is actually fucking beneficial
rather than
like
fabric vs forge
which neither side wins because they're both good for opposite reasons üíÄ
there is no objective winner
solely off of lack of spaghet
unfortunately bedrock suffers from "this should have been an update" sequel/alt version syndrone
~~like ksp 2~~
where
it could be
so much better
and then it just is missing something incredibly important
so it isnt
my first modpack was og tekkit/ tekkit classic i think :clueless:
i dont think i ever played an individual mod standalone back then
was too stupid
admittedly i was like
how old even was i
when was forge created
forge was made in 2011
üòÖ
jesus christ
november 2011 apparently
forge came into existence
i mean
i dont actually remember actually dying to the unmodded ender dragon
even when i was little
and dumb
and could hardly videogame
Except
You have to add the bloat back in
It‚Äôs like surgically removing the fat and then getting a fuckin stomach pump and putting it back in there
Porting lib is a nightmare I‚Äôm sorry
Having to wait 11 minutes for gradle to build is a sin
And i ain‚Äôt even religious
And there‚Äôs probably far more egregious examples
But launching clockwork rn in dev says 74 mods loaded
And something just isn‚Äôt right about that
No joke
We‚Äôve timed it
11 minutes
And considering gradle likes to break and force you to delete gradle folders and rebuild it?

Bye bye
ü§Ø
I said it would be done by end of February
People interpreted that as
Being ready to release
By end of February
There‚Äôs a difference between being done
And I clarified that
I gave myself a date
And regardless
Lod is what I‚Äôm waiting on now
Thankfully it gives more time to polish
You know what happens when you give a date
Ksp2
:clueless:
I literally
Cannot
I don‚Äôt have access to krunch üíÄ
The only c++ thing I‚Äôve been working on has been slowly chipping away at a seperate dynamic connectivity library
You know full well if it was open source what would happen
:clueless:
That‚Äôs horrific
~~And so would aero~~
No
Krunch really doesn‚Äôt need to be open source anyways
I think an aero dev shat on vs2 for it having its engine not be in Java once
What
Krunch is in c++
Aero‚Äôs engine is in uh
God knows what
I think Java or kot
Axo asked
:clueless:
But yeah my only interaction with the c++ side of vs2 is working on dynamic connectivity and that‚Äôs seperate from Krunch
So I cannot write lod for you
You don‚Äôt need Krunch
You can use vscore technically
Triode has full time wagie job
And yes
But he‚Äôs also working on seventeen other things
Lod is priority number ??
Probably 1 or 2
But I think he took over vsbodies and he‚Äôs also working on compound collision shapes
Compounds might be first
I think
Bruh
Listen man
Compound collision shapes are compounding
And vs bodies are bodying
They will be there eventually
Give time
Get good mod
No
They won‚Äôt
Lol
He also works in programming
So
My job at shoprite has paid me more per day then I‚Äôve made in commissions or patreon over my entire life üòÖ
Come at me
Triode has a patreon actually
Paid plugins are cringe
:E_sleepdeprived:
I said
It would be done
By end of month
Not release
Big difference
It‚Äôs not
We haven‚Äôt even done any funny events or anything other than a team vs b team
:diesofdeath:
Speaking of which
No
No reason to shut down sundial for that purpose
Not strong enough tbh
I have another server that can probably support an event‚Ä¶
Okay admittedly that‚Äôs because something is fucked with the modlist
The lag was fine for a while
But there‚Äôs something wrong üíÄ
It‚Äôs not even a forge moment
It‚Äôs one of the mods moment
Call me back when c2me launches
What
Launches

You swine
Call me back when c2me working
Somehow
That turns into launches

That way you‚Äôre a mile away and you have their shoes
Is that bing ai
Ohh
Why is your autocorrect insane
Why am I green now
I‚Äôve been turned into a Christmas tree
I should work on dyn connectivity so I can be a contributor and not split up the greens :clueless:

Smh
Still I don‚Äôt wanna like
Wait until last minute
Then be not ready when lod@suddenly drops
Out of fucking nowhere
I gotta be done soon
Plus we gotta do pre launch events anyways
Can‚Äôt set a deadline
Lod
Has no deadline
For some promised features to work
Yes
A competition for starters
We‚Äôve been waiting to do it since January
No, clockwork is waiting for lod
But I want to release clockwork once lod done
a very simple one
*cracks knuckles*
Incorrect
Lod close
Actually clockwork isn‚Äôt even waiting on just lod
It‚Äôs mostly waiting on the thing before lod
Aka
The almighty
Compound shapes
Not vsbodies
Compounds
The power
üíÄ
Yes probably
Incorrect
You underestimate how close lod is
I wouldn‚Äôt wait on it if it was months out

Let‚Äôs go

I leave for five seconds
smh
Let the memers meme
Inferior to Blahaj
It‚Äôs a gif saying to kys that‚Äôs very clearly a joke
I tell my friends to kys on the regular without obviously intending for them to go and jump off a bridge
:clueless:
Null has probably been told to commit manual brain removal a few hundred times by my hand
@ION are you seriously hurt or offended by the Kys gif
The one playzz sent
.
Then
Who cares
It was a joke between you two
Kys isn‚Äôt really suicide stuff
There‚Äôs a difference between jokingly telling someone to go brain explode and actually making jokes about suicide
One is not okay and the other is a meme
Listen 1984ing people to make sure shit doesn‚Äôt get out of hand is fine but that‚Äôs not in the rules and it‚Äôs evidently not harming anyone but outside spectators‚Ä¶
I was fine with banning the transphobic piece of shit before but I‚Äôm not gonna time someone out for a tenor gif
Yeah
The salego witch trials
You seemed as if you were insisting that I took action against it which is why I was dismissive
I don‚Äôt really care if someone sends a shitty tenor gif with le realization reaction and the caption ‚Äúsolution Kys‚Äù every now and then
I feel like this shouldn‚Äôt be getting as much attention as the literal facist we had before
That I had to ban mid class
Because no one else did
That is a problem
What the fuck did I miss
I come back and I see the word deviant
That‚Äôs harassment
That person was banned from r&d
A long while ago
Damn disguised
Guess what mf
I‚Äôm trans

I can‚Äôt ban someone for religious beliefs if they aren‚Äôt using them as an excuse to be racist üòÖ
I‚Äôd have to ban myself, I‚Äôm technically catholic
Bruh
Would rather not see that shit
Did he say that or did he say he doesn‚Äôt support
I can‚Äôt scroll up my discord is being dumb
You can not actively support something and not be against it
Not supporting =/= going against
Well again that‚Äôs not saying he‚Äôs going against
It does
It says you must love the body god gave you
Or something along those lines
I‚Äôm a catholic trans person
There is a difference
Between Christianity and Catholicism
Christianity and Catholicism are seperate
Let‚Äôs move this there
Not support =/= dislike
Support implies an active effort
To aid
Not giving any active effort doesn‚Äôt mean you dislike
It means you are unrelated
TLDR
people in this discord have no sense of conversation
Take everything with ten pounds of salt

Baritone
So bing ai?
You don‚Äôt need to do that with baritone
Watered down baritone is different
Wurst client baritone =\= baritone‚Äôs full powe
No
Baritone has solo beaten the game
The baritone most people are familiar with is the watered down cheat one controlled with commands
But baritone has a lot more than that under its belt
It can even crystal pvp
It can do a lot lol
It makes decisions towards and end goal
It isn‚Äôt like sentient
But it‚Äôs smart
Baritone is specifically trained to absolutely demolish mc so it‚Äôs less of an artificial intelligence and more of an artificial tryhard

had some hot choco
the fuck did i miss
@YAROBONZ is dead?
:snap:
i disagree
nah but actually likje
why
what did he do
ewou seems to have timed him out for not respecting moderator judgement
üíÄ
bro
i didnt
i timed him out for a day
instead of a whole ass week
cause thats just
excessive
i was going to but my mother called üíÄ
7 days for being a rat is excessive
didn't like respect mod judgement or something
i wouldve not timed him out at all but also something poltiical before
so i kept a day
no
its wild west
also ewou to be fair you did time him out without like
yes i went "from yarobonz" in search
we'll get there eventually
because it wasn't communicated
i would understand that in a situation where the reasoning is major
like i dont think anyone has qualms with me banning the self proclaimed facist yesterday
but like
why are ruby and ewou in f tier
ü§®
what even is that tierlist
like what is being ranked
i get that but im asking what the ranking os for
i feel like mic is just poking the bear here
you're talking contradictorily
no just in general
??
you're saying mods have no freedom to do stuff and yet mods do have freedom to undo eachother's actions
that's the opposite
that's more of a kindergarten fight
that exists
ewou silently did it though
then by that logic
a week timeout is a long ass time for minor transgressions which i was under the assumption were all that had been done
i admit that immediately taking action on my part was kinda dumb
what was "it"
Genuine question
i banned someone yesterday of my own whim
do medium or high
honestly
thatll handle spammers
or bots
kinda
well a lot of bot accounts are made like
ah wait thats five minutes
i thought that said 5 days
tf cares about an account made 5 minutes ago
Clockwork is not out yet
:chad:
I have said quite a few times that clockwork wasn‚Äôt releasing at the end of February and would just be done by it (it isn‚Äôt anyways quite yet but shh) but I‚Äôm waiting on lod
??
It‚Äôs waiting on lod now
I‚Äôm taking the extra time to polish it
So you asked the first month of development when it would be done
And expected that to be a final answer
Andrupka don‚Äôt get too overzealous
They asked a question smh
He angy
Here‚Äôs the thing
funny abstract physics object time

andrupka :3drevenge:
üíÄ
No
Yes I know it‚Äôs annoying to go from ‚Äúend of February‚Äù to ‚Äúsometime in March‚Äù
But lod important
Otherwise no friction
And if no friction
Lightspeed
level of detail
it‚Äôs physical block properties
friction, bounciness, shit like that
It‚Äôs waiting on vsbodies which are waiting on compound shapes which are all triode‚Äôs duties now
Jfc
Taco scroll up ten messages
Yes being able to slide across a flat surface without being slowed down is kinda bad
Since ya know
Planes landing and all
that‚Äôs not a warp drive
That‚Äôs a bumper car
And it‚Äôs going to bump the chunk load speed limit üíÄ
HAH
You poor innocent soul
It‚Äôs not complicated as in indepth
It‚Äôs complicated as in ‚Äúboilerplate hell‚Äù
Create code is
Essentially
Based on years of spaghetti
With new features simply adding to the pasta
Instead of cleaning anything up
Latest create still uses so many of it‚Äôs own *deprecated methods*
That have been deprecated since two versions ago
And have better alternatives
Because they dont go back and change old stuff
It is broke
Create needs an optimization mod attached to it to run decently
No
Performance wise create is abysmal
It sucks with shaders because flywheel is the only thing keeping it semi stable
And shaders disable flywheel
It disables flywheel‚Äôs instancing engine
Their own trailer was recorded at 10x playback speed
Not real-time
Because it was too laggy
That‚Äôs not a joke, read ‚ÄúThis is Create 0.5‚Äù‚Äôs YouTube description
It was made using minema reloaded
And running the game at a tenth speed
Flywheel Is actually a good optimization mod
But
But
You don‚Äôt get the full effects
To just be average
Did you know every shaft in create is a tile entity
üíÄ
Everything in create is a tile entity
That‚Äôs why none of it burns :clueless:
Even fucking casings are tile entities
They don‚Äôt tick tho
But casings
Which are just blocks
Also create‚Äôs instancing engine is mental
Everything that has a shaft has to extend ShaftInstance
That‚Äôs why nothing has shafts in clockwork showcases
We haven‚Äôt added instances for our mechanical blocks yet
Because they‚Äôre a polish thing
I‚Äôve been starting on them
Most of them can just use modified versions of existing create block instances though
Like the flap bearing
Or propellor bearing
Which are just bearings with extra steps
:clueless:
Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to accomplish
They did
But
They changed the way they detect impacts
‚Ä¶which broke it
The change doesn‚Äôt even really improve performance
It checks the world chunk now instead of checking if it‚Äôs clipping directly I think
Which is weird
Seperate entity hit check
I‚Äôm just gonna mixin cbc to undo that ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù in vs2
:clueless:
Ez
Yeah but cbc wasn‚Äôt really that laggy before
It was the spam particles the cannon emits after firing
That block your vision
Optimization is always relevant
But the commit that broke it even had optimized in quotes iirc

He don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs optimizations
üíÄ
I believe this is the problem @ewoudjeüöÄ
I don‚Äôt know what getting the chunk at even does for optimization
It seems like more random function calls
Also could be this

Without friction you can abscond to lightspeed on the ground and that‚Äôs no good smh

Yes

A part
Yes
That‚Äôs what I sai
Ya know with everyone talking about lod
I should work on dynamic connectivity so I can snap a plane in half in clockwork‚Äôs trailer :clueless:
I do not
That‚Äôs the point
BeamNG is not a physics engine
Torque3D
Er
:Thonk:
Depends on how the dynamic connectivity implementation works
I‚Äôm still not fully sure myself
It‚Äôs a graph so it may be all neighbors or it may be only direct neighbors
It uses torque3d

Ah sorry it actually uses modified physx
Which is part of torque



They‚Äôve used torque since 2013
They do have proprietary physics changes tho
It‚Äôs not the stock engine
Smh
Krunch better trol
Their engine is based off physx so no contest clearly trol
Bruh
Davinki
It‚Äôs not the most efficient anymore
:TrollDespair:
also
My ap Java course is so pathetic
They don‚Äôt even have a functioning math class
:diesofdeath:
Literally
It lets me compile it but when I submit it the grader program doesn‚Äôt recognize it

üíÄ
By the way
I‚Äôm just tryna use Math.min so I don‚Äôt have to make this program 5 lines longer than it needs to be
But fuck it
They want to be like that
Time to make this excessive by writing my own math.min
Not allowed
:clueless:
It doesn‚Äôt let me import real Java classes unless it has already imported them itself
Like java.util.Scanner
It is not :clueless:
You have to import testing.Math to get access to math methods
Not joking
This ide is scuffed as hell
It‚Äôs like butchered java
The grader is beyond my understanding
Code that works perfectly in testing won‚Äôt grade correctly
Code that doesn‚Äôt work at all in testing grades 100%
You can literally initialize an array list wrong
And the grader will still pass it
But it won‚Äôt run cause of unsafe operations
üíÄ
Putting the type of the array list on the wrong side
Like when writing out `ArrayList<> things = new ArrayList<>`
It will be unsafe or unchecked ops if it‚Äôs on one side in the compiler (the type constructor)
But the grader doesn‚Äôt give a rats ass
Yeah.
It‚Äôs an array list of java.object üíÄ
Yes
It makes an array list of just object
I can prove it actually
Hold on
Ik im saying this compiler is drunk
This also means they use two
Seperate custom compilers or whatever
For their shitty ide
Because if the grader passes it and the normal one doesn‚Äôt
Then like
???
But the normal one won‚Äôt let me use math classes
And the grader won‚Äôt let me change imports
It‚Äôs a fucking travesty
Some weird school website
I haven‚Äôt tested grading
But you know what
I‚Äôd almost not be surprised if the grader approved of it
No
You‚Äôre paying to get into the ecosystem
Where programs tend to be specialized for the hardware and offset the raw power difference
Plus apple hardware being subpar isn‚Äôt really as true anymore
Not shilling apple cause they‚Äôre a terrible company with terrible business practices but
Their products aren‚Äôt actually bad
Their company is
Big difference
If apple products were made by anyone respectable
I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy into them
Cause they do have genuine merits
Just uh
Apple itself doesn‚Äôt

Oh yeah
VS stuff stopped being detected by cannon shots a few nightly‚Äôs ago
It‚Äôs recent so I think it came from the patch optimizing shell hit detection
It worked fine in a nightly I have actually
It doesn‚Äôt work with vs2 in general atm
I have the build they still work in
One sec
CBC nightly broke it
As I said I think it was the optimization commit you made for shell hit detection
Or idk if it was detection
I saw it while scrolling the commit history to see what could‚Äôve broke
Bet
Multiloadering create addons is a journey, I wish you luck
Clockwork had the advantage of starting on fabric which made porting it to common a lot easier
Yeah I saw a commit that changed this a bit ago
I believe this commit is what broke it https://github.com/rbasamoyai/CreateBigCannons/commit/b1308e6c1ed494221cbb3b5abeef9ab924e5aa84
Anyways I‚Äôll look into it more once I‚Äôm home
Of course I have no idea if that‚Äôs right but the build I have from before this date works
@Rubydesic
Or @ewoudjeüöÄ
Smh
No :3drevenge:
You‚Äôre right
Then it probably is
Shouldn‚Äôt be a hard fix and I think we can do it on our end if absolutely necessary I just haven‚Äôt gotten around to fixing it cause clockwork gaming
That would probably be why it‚Äôs not working then
üíÄ
I‚Äôm assuming before that commit it did
At least in some capacity
Skull emoji
ez dubs
On the way home gamers
It‚Äôs time to get back to the coding grindset
I‚Äôve worked nonstop for like 6 days straight so I‚Äôm glad I finally have a day to work on coding
First things first I‚Äôll fix cbc compat
Since the issue is piss easy to fix now
And then I guess I‚Äôll get to bugfixing
I don‚Äôt really have any content left to add anymore
And that‚Äôs the fun part for me
Pensive
At least for this update lol
I have plans for next update but those need to wait until I‚Äôm done polishing what we have
the port to 1.19.2 is in a playtesting state
you can build it yourself i think on github maybe
unsure
though im unsure if 1.19.2 forge works
i know 1.19.2 fabric vs2 does
i guess you could say itll be done toloddo
no its not tomorrow
that was a pun
Woke up at 4:30 am and am running on 3 hours of sleep :armold_schwarzenegger:
Kill me
Yeah well I‚Äôve been running on near no sleep for too long
It stopped in like 2015
Nah nvm 2020
I was thinking of xp
Win7 doesn‚Äôt get updates anymore
Cannons work fine, only issue is that cbc switched to its own clip detection for ??reasons
So we have to mixin to fix that
You can‚Äôt hit ships with a cannon
That‚Äôs a skill issue
The shell passes through
Because the clip detection is borked with ships
‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm not gonna bother re explaining
Have you powered the other side with a lever
Or loaded it properly
They do fire
I‚Äôm saying they do fire, the shells just can‚Äôt hit ships atm
Yes I know
Create big cannons use their own clip detection for no reason in particular
So we have to mixin it
Replace one of the barrels
It didn‚Äôt connect properly
Happens
Wait a minute
What version of vs2 are you on
Beta what
:squinty:
Full modlist
Also what cbc version
It isn‚Äôt because that‚Äôs cap
:Thonk:
Latest cbc?
Pinned a message.
>Log onto a server
Why is there a flat earther discussion going on now
I leave for five minutes and the iq of everyone in the server fluctuates like a sine wave
We didn‚Äôt make the Ryan ai
At least not the first
There was a Ryan ai from ages ago
1 impostor among us
It was yaro
Put klarkson and Ryan in a room
How long will it take for klarkson to remove his spleen
No don‚Äôt turn me into a marketable artificial intellige
:guh:
Hold on
That‚Äôs not even my handle
Wait this is literally life 2
Gamers there‚Äôs an alert
One of aero‚Äôs contributors zoinked r&d‚Äôs models and they‚Äôve got Ivy

Also they like tried to taunt me over it in dms and failed
Skull emoji
Aw hell naw
They have an outdated klarkson model, the atomic Ivy model, the mech model, and presumably anything else I made in the last few months
But like
The create community knows who klarkson is at this point
It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre about to claim my work as theirs
Are you getting into the semantics of how to best correlate a poultry meal to infant cannibalism
Wait actually
Human meat is saline isn‚Äôt it
Jesus condones cannibalism?
was working on new stickers for R&D and let it be reminded just how massive the mech is

:speen:

i literally didnt say more than a sentence
i just sent an image an emoji and a video
.
:diesofdeath:
in a sha512 clearly
:clueless:
one of these days im gonna put an R&D teaser inside a clockwork teaser and no one will be prepared
because not everyone has cc
and the command seat is very different
LMFAO
no
you shouldve kept it at "it isnt"
"yeah you know when you stop turning?"
did you not remmeber
that is exactly its height
LMFAO
I enjoy the animation changes clueless
While waiting for my shift to start (got to work early) I‚Äôm just gonna vibe
Got nothing else to do
:mistaken:
Time to update some R&D emojis from images I have saved on my phone
:clueless:
:klarkson: :ivy:
:doubletrouble:
:mekabruh:
:pickedthewronghousefool:
:steamandatom:
I can‚Äôt add stickers from mobile
Cackling
bruh
Adam and Steve
The old double trouble

Vs the new

Triple threat
Ivy needed a rework
And also I agreed
I just didn‚Äôt want to remake Ivy
:clueless:
Now I did
Far better as a result
:speeeen:
New speen dropped

Gif is actually that compressed btw
LMAO
lmfao
Here we can see a rare sight
People with a lower iq than vs2 discord members
Probably
But you never know
What about it
:mistaken:
:speeeen:
The truth
:speeeen:
